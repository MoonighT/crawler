For  O
the  O
last  O
few  O
days  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
seeing  O
people  O
talking  O
about  O
Yuet  B-ORG
Loy  I-ORG
on  O
social  O
media  O
and  O
that  O
reminded  O
me  O
that  O
I  O
still  O
have  O
not  O
blog  O
about  O
my  O
visit  O
to  O
Yuet  B-ORG
Loy  I-ORG
(  O
)  O
at  O
Chinatown  O
Complex  O
Market  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
brought  O
me  O
to  O
the  O
popular  O
stall  O
because  O
her  O
mum  O
frequent  O
this  O
zichar  O
stall  O
and  O
always  O
brought  O
home  O
delectable  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
located  O
right  O
at  O
the  O
far  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
hawker  O
centre  O
near  O
the  O
corner  O
close  O
to  O
the  O
Buddha  O
Tooth  O
Relic  O
Temple  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
visiting  O
the  O
stall  O
so  O
I  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
very  O
sure  O
what  O
to  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
easy  O
way  O
out  O
and  O
ordered  O
2  O
dishes  O
that  O
is  O
recommended  O
on  O
their  O
stall  O
's  O
signage  O
.  O

The  O
zichar  O
stall  O
is  O
really  O
popular  O
and  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
40  O
minutes  O
for  O
our  O
food  O
.  O

Salted  B-F
Fish  I-F
Chicken  I-F
4/5  O

The  O
Salted  B-F
Fish  I-F
Chicken  I-F
was  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

The  O
saltiness  O
of  O
the  O
salted  O
fish  O
worked  O
perfectly  O
with  O
the  O
chicken  O
enhancing  O
the  O
flavours  O
further  O
.  O

A  O
perfect  O
savoury  O
dish  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
hoping  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
salted  O
fish  O
like  O
a  O
thick  O
gravy  O
.  O

Black  B-F
Bean  I-F
Sauce  I-F
Fish  I-F
Head  I-F
3/5  O

While  O
the  O
Black  O
Bean  O
Sauce  O
Fish  O
Head  O
was  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
black  O
bean  O
sauce  O
,  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
Song  O
Fish  O
(  O
Asian  O
Carp  O
)  O
maybe  O
consider  O
acquire  O
to  O
some  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
muddy  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
acceptable  O
to  O
the  O
muddy  O
taste  O
but  O
not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
humble  O
zichar  O
stall  O
serves  O
some  O
delish  O
homecook  O
style  O
food  O
and  O
I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
like  O
to  O
return  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
Beef  B-F
Sliced  I-F
Hor  I-F
Fun  I-F
and  O
Golden  B-F
Coin  I-F
Tofu  I-F
which  O
seems  O
to  O
be  O
their  O

The  O
question  O
has  O
been  O
asked  O
,  O
where  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
Popiah  O
in  O
Singapore  O
?  O

I  O
am  O
sure  O
many  O
has  O
their  O
own  O
favourite  O
but  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
hearing  O
about  O
the  O
queue  O
at  O
this  O
small  O
stall  O
tucked  O
again  O
in  O
a  O
corner  O
ofa  O
coffeeshop  O
at  O
Clementi  O
Avenue  O
3  O
where  O
the  O
popular  O
Brothers  O
Rojak  O
is  O
located  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
known  O
as  O
Jit  B-ORG
It  I-ORG
Thai  I-ORG
San  I-ORG
Popiah  I-ORG
(  O
)  O
is  O
run  O
by  O
2  O
elderly  O
while  O
the  O
lady  O
auntie  O
is  O
incharge  O
of  O
making  O
the  O
popiah  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
stall  O
,  O
there  O
was  O
already  O
aqueue  O
.  O

I  O
patiently  O
waited  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
25  O
minutes  O
for  O
my  O
popiah  O
although  O
there  O
was  O
just  O
like  O
4-5  O
people  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
me  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
,  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
faster  O
but  O
I  O
think  O
age  O
has  O
caught  O
up  O
with  O
the  O
owners  O
and  O
theie  O
pace  O
has  O
slowed  O
down  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
queuing  O
for  O
my  O
turn  O
,  O
I  O
post  O
on  O
facebook  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
checking  O
out  O
this  O
popiah  O
stall  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
warned  O
to  O
keep  O
my  O
order  O
simple  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
received  O
a  O
text  O
from  O
my  O
partner  O
that  O
the  O
auntie  O
is  O
quite  O
fierce  O
.  O

True  O
enough  O
,  O
a  O
lady  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
me  O
wasscolded  O
by  O
the  O
stallauntie  O
for  O
her  O
confusing  O
order  O
.  O

Upon  O
my  O
turn  O
,  O
I  O
kept  O
it  O
simple  O
and  O
ordered  O
2  O
Popiah  B-F
roll  O
(  O
$  B-P
1.50  I-P
each  O
)  O
,  O
one  O
with  O
chilli  O
and  O
the  O
other  O
without  O
.  O

When  O
she  O
finished  O
preparing  O
the  O
popiah  O
.  O

you  O
place  O
the  O
money  O
on  O
the  O
plastic  O
tray  O
for  O
her  O
to  O
collect  O
.  O

I  O
feel  O
that  O
the  O
popiah  O
at  O
Jit  B-ORG
It  I-ORG
Thai  I-ORG
San  I-ORG
Popiah  I-ORG
stands  O
out  O
in  O
3  O
areas  O
.  O

First  O
is  O
the  O
thin  O
and  O
soft  O
popiah  O
skin  O
that  O
is  O
stuffed  O
with  O
turnips  O
,  O
beansprouts  O
,  O
hard  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
and  O
peanuts  O
.  O

Second  O
,  O
the  O
popiah  O
comes  O
with  O
garlic  O
which  O
further  O
enhanced  O
the  O
flavour  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
the  O
special  O
chilli  O
that  O
will  O
send  O
the  O
tasting  O
buds  O
sambal  O
dancing  O
.  O

The  O

serves  O
coffee  O
crafted  O
from  O
a  O
blend  O
of  O
Sidama  O
,  O
Antigua  O
and  O
Lintong  O
while  O
some  O
small  O
bites  O
are  O
also  O
sold  O
here  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
almost  O
7pmwhen  O
I  O
visited  O
Kiasu  O
Espresso  O
hence  O
the  O
cafe  O
was  O
rather  O
empty  O
since  O
it  O
was  O
dinner  O
time.I  O
was  O
looknig  O
for  O
a  O
place  O
to  O
hang  O
out  O
while  O
I  O
waited  O
for  O
my  O
dinner  O
at  O
8pm  O
which  O
is  O
just  O
next  O
door  O
atBar-Roque  O
Grill  O
.  O

Latte  O
and  O
Macchiato  O
3/5  O

I  O
ordered  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
Latte  O
while  O
my  O
friend  O
has  O
the  O
Macchiato  O
.  O

I  O
know  O
my  O
people  O
has  O
good  O
words  O
for  O
the  O
coffee  O
at  O
Kiasu  O
Espresso  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
my  O
caffeine  O
.  O

I  O
found  O
the  O
blend  O
too  O
bitter  O
to  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
bitter  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
wondering  O
whether  O
milk  O
was  O
added  O
.  O

By  O
the  O
way  O
I  O
always  O
have  O
latte  O
without  O
sugar  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Tart  O
1/5  O

As  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
late  O
already  O
,  O
there  O
was  O
n't  O
much  O
to  O
choose  O
for  O
our  O
snack  O
.  O

We  O
ended  O
up  O
with  O
a  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
which  O
added  O
to  O
our  O
misery  O
.  O

First  O
the  O
tart  O
was  O
being  O
heated  O
up  O
until  O
the  O
dark  O
chocolate  O
filling  O
turned  O
into  O
molten  O
form  O
with  O
a  O
weird  O
plastic  O
like  O
layer  O
on  O
top  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
really  O
unappertising  O
and  O
weird  O
that  O
we  O
left  O
it  O
basically  O
untouched  O
.  O

While  O
my  O
experience  O
at  O
Kiasu  O
Espresso  O
is  O
not  O
the  O
best  O
,  O
I  O
may  O
still  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
pastry  O
there  O
since  O
they  O
are  O
from  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Bakery  O
.  O

Hopefully  O
the  O
coffee  O
will  O
be  O
better  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
,  O
maybe  O
the  O
barista  O
has  O
a  O
bad  O
day  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
super  O
overdue  O
post  O
dated  O
back  O
in  O
June  O
2013  O
when  O
we  O
celebrated  O
Jacob  O
and  O
Shiting  O
's  O
birthday  O
at  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
(  O
)  O
.  O

Founded  O
in  O
Sichuan  O
back  O
in  O
1994  O
,  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
has  O
been  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
biggest  O
hotpot  O
chain  O
in  O
China  O
with  O
over  O
50  O
outlets  O
in  O
different  O
major  O
cities  O
of  O
China  O
.  O

After  O
their  O
recent  O
opening  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
it  O
has  O
received  O
many  O
good  O
reviews  O
for  O
their  O
food  O
and  O
excellent  O
service  O
drawing  O
daily  O
long  O
queues  O
.  O

To  O
avoid  O
disappointment  O
,  O
I  O
called  O
weeks  O
in  O
advance  O
and  O
was  O
told  O
to  O
come  O
at  O
6pm  O
or  O
I  O
will  O
have  O
to  O
queue  O
like  O
the  O
rest  O
.  O

At  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
section  O
where  O
you  O
can  O
help  O
yourself  O
to  O
free  O
flow  O
appertizer  O
and  O
fruits  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
also  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
your  O
own  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
your  O
hotpot  O
cooked  O
food  O
.  O

My  O
memory  O
is  O
failing  O
me  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
remember  O
the  O
price  O
and  O
what  O
exactly  O
we  O
have  O
ordered  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
wrong  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Assorted  O
Vegetables  O
and  O
Assorted  O
Mushrooms  O
to  O
start  O
with  O
.  O

Ordering  O
is  O
done  O
through  O
the  O
ipad  O
but  O
the  O
service  O
staff  O
is  O
always  O
there  O
to  O
help  O
whenever  O
if  O
you  O
need  O
it  O
.  O

IfI  O
remembered  O
correctly  O
,  O
this  O
isthe  O
Meat  O
Dumpling  O
which  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
delectable  O
fillings  O
which  O
we  O
all  O
enjoyed  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
have  O
the  O
Kurobota  O
Pork  O
,  O
Fish  O
Slices  O
and  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Flavoured  O
Beef  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
our  O
Seafood  O
and  O
Spicy  O
Soup  O
Base  O
.  O

Be  O
warned  O
that  O
their  O
Spicy  O
soup  O
base  O
is  O
fiery  O
.  O

We  O
have  O
to  O
reduce  O
the  O
spiciness  O
by  O
diluting  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
seafood  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
menu  O
offers  O
quite  O
an  O
extensive  O
selection  O
of  O
fresh  O
and  O
quality  O
meat  O
too  O
.  O

Just  O
be  O
careful  O
with  O
your  O
selection  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
want  O
to  O
burn  O
a  O
hole  O
in  O
your  O
wallet  O

that  O
do  O
not  O

Love  O
to  O

so  O
I  O
could  O
helping  O
having  O
the  O

,  O

,  O

Nicoise  O
Salad  O
4/5  O

Nicoise  O
Salad  O
is  O
a  O
dish  O
popularized  O
by  O
The  O
French  O
Chef  O
,  O
Julia  O
Child  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O

comes  O
with  O
delectable  O

Steak  O
and  O
Eggs  O
4/5  O

For  O
something  O
filling  O
,  O
the  O
Steak  O
and  O
Eggs  O
probably  O
will  O
satisfy  O
the  O
hungry  O
stomach  O
.  O

Cooked  O
beautifully  O
is  O
the  O
125gram  O

Quarter  O
Dozen  O
Jet  O
Fresh  O
Oysters  O
on  O
Ice  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
usually  O
do  O
n't  O
take  O
oyster  O
early  O
in  O
the  O
day  O
as  O
I  O
am  O
worry  O
that  O
my  O
stomach  O
has  O
not  O
warmed  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
freshness  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
just  O
could  O
not  O
resist  O
having  O
the  O
Quarter  O
Dozen  O
Jet  O
Fresh  O
Oysters  O
on  O
Ice  O
.  O

The  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O
oysters  O
was  O
further  O
enhanced  O
by  O
topping  O
of  O
ikura  O
,  O
lemon  O
emulsion  O
,  O
cucumber  O
jello  O
and  O
micro  O
herbs  O

Arrabbiata  O
4.5/5  O

Our  O
host  O
raved  O
about  O
the  O
pasta  O
at  O
Ku  O
De  O
Ta  O
and  O
I  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
confirm  O
it  O
with  O
my  O
own  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
good  O
thing  O
about  O
the  O
ala  O
carte  O
dishes  O
come  O
in  O
a  O
smaller  O
tasting  O
like  O
portion  O
which  O
means  O
I  O
can  O
basically  O
taste  O
every  O
item  O
on  O
the  O
huge  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
Arrabbiata  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
al  O

.  O

The  O
penne  O
pasta  O
is  O
tossed  O
in  O
a  O

tomato  O
sauce  O
,  O
pitted  O
olives  O
and  O
herb  O
scented  O

with  O
all  O
the  O
flavours  O
working  O
together  O
in  O
harmony  O

Laksa  O
4/5  O

To  O
cater  O
for  O
the  O

palate  O
wanting  O
to  O
sample  O
the  O
local  O

,  O
the  O

at  O

has  O
created  O
the  O
Laksa  O
linguine  O
with  O
laksa  O
essence  O
and  O
tiger  O
prawn  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyable  O
dish  O
with  O
fresh  O
tiger  O
prawn  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
spot  O
on  O
but  O
nothing  O
close  O
to  O
the  O
lemak  O
laksa  O
our  O
local  O
palate  O
is  O
more  O
familiar  O
with  O
.  O

Carbonara  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
was  O
singing  O
in  O
joy  O
when  O
the  O
Carbonara  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
poached  O
egg  O

The  O
flavours  O
of  O

lardons  O
,  O
white  O
wine  O
confit  O
shallot  O
and  O
garlic  O
,  O
parmesan  O
cheese  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
with  O
the  O
ala  O
dente  O
linguine  O
pasta  O
.  O

I  O
concurred  O
the  O
pasta  O
at  O
Ku  O
De  O
Ta  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
try  O
.  O

I  O
even  O
made  O
the  O
remark  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
so  O
called  O
Italian  O
Kitchen  O
newly  O
opened  O
at  O
Vivocity  O
.  O

I  O
was  O

flavourful  O
interpretation  O
with  O
springy  O
noodles  O
and  O
tender  O
chicken  O

.  O

Strawberry  O
Yogurt  O
Pot  O
4.2/5  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
dessert  O
,  O
I  O
discovered  O
a  O
pot  O
of  O
treasure  O
in  O
the  O
Strawberry  O
Yogurt  O
Pot  O
.  O

The  O
blend  O
of  O
Greek  O
yogurt  O
,  O
fresh  O
strawberries  O
,  O
honey  O
and  O
vanilla  O
worked  O
beautifully  O
teasing  O
my  O
palate  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

Amercian  O
Style  O
Pancakes  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
classic  O
Amercian  O
Style  O
Pancake  O
with  O
blueberry  O
,  O
caramelized  O
almond  O
and  O
white  O
chocolate  O

was  O
thick  O
,  O
buttery  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

Focaccia  O
French  O
Toast  O
3/5  O

The  O
Focaccia  O
French  O
Toast  O
with  O
the  O
sour  O
cherry  O
compote  O
and  O
vanilla  O
whipped  O
cream  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
having  O
the  O
eggy  O
bread  O
with  O
the  O
light  O
and  O
airy  O
vanilla  O
whipped  O
cream  O
lending  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
sweetness  O
to  O
the  O
savoury  O
dish  O
.  O

Cake  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
-  O
Strawberry  O
Fruit  O
Cake  O
4/5  O

The  O
cake  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
was  O
the  O
Strawberry  O
Fruit  O
Cake  O
.  O

Every  O
weekend  O
there  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
different  O
flavour  O
made  O
with  O
the  O
freshest  O
ingredients  O
.  O

The  O
cake  O
was  O
very  O
light  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
it  O
is  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
foreign  O

Katong  O

and  O
I  O
know  O
how  O
competitive  O
the  O

can  O
be  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
seen  O
many  O
restaurants  O
opened  O
and  O
gone  O
but  O
Smiths  O
Authentic  O
British  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
stood  O
tall  O
winning  O
the  O
palates  O
of  O
many  O
with  O
their  O
authentic  O
and  O
traditional  O
British  O
fish  O
and  O

all  O
these  O
years  O
.  O

Fish  O

Chips  O

At  O
Smiths  O
,  O
they  O
do  O
n't  O
just  O
serve  O
you  O
fish  O
and  O
chips  O
.  O

Patron  O
actually  O
has  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
4  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
white  O
fish  O
in  O
Cod  O
,  O

Deep  O

with  O
their  O

,  O
their  O

is  O
served  O
wrapped  O
in  O
a  O

To  O
be  O
safe  O
,  O
I  O
recommend  O
going  O
for  O
the  O

(  O

for  O
180-200g  O

is  O
the  O
more  O
popular  O
choice  O
among  O
the  O

types  O
of  O

.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
fish  O
and  O
chips  O
and  O
my  O
attention  O
was  O
drawn  O
to  O
the  O
sauces  O
and  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

Actually  O
the  O
fish  O
is  O
not  O
marinated  O
so  O
itself  O
was  O
bland  O
.  O

You  O
need  O
to  O
splash  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
vinegar  O
and  O
salt  O
available  O
at  O
table  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
made  O
it  O
more  O
palatable  O

these  O

Salmon  O
Fish  O
Cakes  O
2.5/5  O

We  O
all  O
know  O
that  O
salmon  O
is  O
a  O
delicate  O
fish  O
which  O
can  O
be  O
easily  O
overcooked  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
by  O
deep  O
frying  O
the  O
Salmon  O
Fish  O
Cakes  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
for  O
2pc  O
)  O
spoilt  O
the  O
beautiful  O
fish  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
impressed  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

Beef  O
and  O
Guinness  O
Pie  O
4/5  O

A  O
must  O
try  O
at  O
Smiths  O
is  O
the  O
Beef  O
and  O
Guinness  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
8.50/pc  O
)  O
.  O

Baked  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
flaky  O
pastry  O
and  O
gorgeous  O
beef  O
filling  O
simmered  O
with  O
Guinness  O
will  O
send  O
you  O
on  O
a  O
high  O
but  O
not  O
drunk  O
.  O

Battered  O
Pineapple  O
Rings  O
3/5  O

Quite  O
surprisingly  O
,  O
Smiths  O
actually  O
has  O
dessert  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
Battered  O
Pineapple  O
Rings  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
gave  O
a  O
sweet  O
ending  O
change  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
fried  O
stuff  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
too  O
sure  O
but  O
the  O
pineapple  O
tasted  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
from  O
the  O
can  O
fried  O
in  O
a  O
light  O
batter  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
nothing  O
much  O
to  O
shout  O
about  O
.  O

Battered  O
MARS  O
Bar  O
3/5  O

My  O
first  O
encounter  O
of  O
deep  O
fried  O
MARS  O
bar  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
at  O
The  O
Ascot  O
.  O

The  O
version  O
at  O
Smiths  O
was  O
sweet  O
,  O
sticky  O
and  O
a  O
crispy  O
batter  O
to  O
balance  O
the  O
sweetness  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
crunch  O
.  O

At  O
Smiths  O
British  O
Fish  O
&  O
Chips  O
,  O
my  O
recommendation  O
is  O
not  O
to  O
be  O
overwhelmed  O
by  O
all  O
the  O
fried  O
stuff  O
.  O

Go  O
for  O
the  O
sides  O
or  O
pickled  O
ingredients  O
to  O
add  O
some  O
colours  O
and  O
varieties  O
to  O
your  O

the  O

(  O

&  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
(  O
$  O

it  O
actually  O
quite  O
tasty  O
,  O
smooth  O
and  O
silky  O
.  O

Pan  O
Fried  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
believed  O
that  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
has  O
tweaked  O
the  O
recipe  O
for  O
the  O
Pan  O
Fried  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
for  O

)  O
a  O
bit  O
.  O

The  O
previous  O
time  O
I  O
had  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
crispy  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

Flavour  O
wise  O
it  O
was  O
also  O
on  O
the  O
lighter  O
side  O
but  O
now  O
its  O
more  O
fragrant  O
.  O

Steamed  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
big  O
4  O
heavenly  O
king  O
dim  O
sum  O
at  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
,  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3.80  O
)  O
never  O
failed  O
to  O
bring  O
a  O
smile  O
to  O
me  O
with  O
its  O
sweet  O
eggy  O
flavour  O
and  O
spongy  O
texture  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
commonly  O
served  O
in  O
other  O
dim  O
sum  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Baked  O
Bun  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
4.2/5  O

There  O
were  O
mixed  O
review  O
of  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
's  O
signature  O
Baked  O
Bun  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
when  O
it  O
first  O
opened  O
at  O
Plaza  O
Singapura  O
.  O

Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
Singapore  O
has  O
since  O
tweaked  O
the  O
recipe  O
and  O
accordingly  O
to  O
someone  O
who  O
has  O
tried  O
the  O
same  O
item  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
,  O
the  O
Singapore  O
version  O
is  O
now  O
closer  O
to  O
what  O
she  O
had  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
.  O

Now  O
the  O
baked  O
bun  O
has  O
a  O
sweet  O
crispy  O
custard  O
layer  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
previous  O
version  O
I  O
had  O
while  O
it  O
also  O
reduced  O
the  O
sweetness  O
level  O
of  O
the  O
fillings  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
tasted  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
Bo  O
Luo  O
Bao  O
with  O
the  O
sweet  O
custard  O
exterior  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Chicken  O
Feet  O
with  O
Abalone  O
Sauce  O
4.2/5  O

Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
has  O
come  O
up  O
with  O
6  O
new  O
dishes  O
exclusively  O
only  O
at  O
the  O
Toa  O
Payoh  O
outlet  O
.  O

However  O
these  O
are  O
only  O
monthly  O
specials  O
and  O
the  O
line-up  O
with  O
change  O
every  O
month  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
these  O
6  O
new  O
dishes  O
is  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Chicken  O
Feet  O
with  O
Abalone  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
)  O
.  O

Chicken  O
feet  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
those  O
item  O
I  O
will  O
definitely  O
order  O
when  O
I  O
have  O
dim  O
sum  O
and  O
I  O
am  O
glad  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
finally  O
introduced  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
abalone  O
sauce  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
to  O
what  O
we  O
usually  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Wasabi  O
Salad  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
4.5/5  O

As  O
Chef  O
Mak  O
has  O
mentioned  O
in  O
his  O
earlier  O
interview  O
,  O
he  O
realised  O
Singaporean  O
loves  O
their  O
fried  O
food  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
a  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
Wasabi  O
Salad  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
)  O
being  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
6  O
new  O
dishes  O
.  O

Stuffed  O
with  O
big  O
succulent  O
prawns  O
and  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
,  O
both  O
adults  O
and  O
children  O
will  O
definitely  O
love  O
it  O
.  O

Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
Sweet  O
and  O
Sesame  O
Sauce  O
3/5  O

The  O
other  O
new  O
dish  O
is  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
Sweet  O
and  O
Sesame  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.20  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
roll  O
but  O
I  O
doubt  O
this  O
will  O
be  O
greatly  O
accepted  O
by  O
the  O
local  O
as  O
its  O
plain  O
vermicelli  O
roll  O
without  O
fillings  O
.  O

Fried  O
Noodle  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
and  O
Soy  O
Sauce  O
3/5  O

I  O
know  O
the  O
people  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
loves  O
their  O
congee  O
and  O
noodles  O
for  O
breakfast  O
or  O
dim  O
sum  O
but  O
I  O
doubt  O
Singaporean  O
shares  O
the  O
same  O
palate  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

As  O
a  O
dish  O
itself  O
,  O
the  O
Fried  O
Noodle  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
and  O
Soy  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
6.00  O
)  O
was  O
delectable  O
with  O
springy  O
noodles  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
just  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
Singaporean  O
will  O
order  O
it  O
for  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Salted  O
Meat  O
4/5  O

The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Salted  O
Meat  O
(  O
$  O
3.80  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
dim  O
sum  O
dish  O
not  O
many  O
Singaporean  O
is  O
familiar  O
with  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
know  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
quite  O
popular  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
dumpling  O
is  O
actually  O
hollow  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
filled  O
only  O
about  O
a  O
quarter  O
in  O
it  O
with  O
salted  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
of  O
this  O
dim  O
sum  O
item  O
is  O
the  O
chewy  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
dumpling  O
.  O

The  O
more  O
I  O
chewed  O
on  O
it  O
the  O
more  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
.  O

Mango  O
Pomelo  O
Sago  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Mango  O
Pomelo  O
Sago  O
(  O
$  O
5.00  O
)  O
need  O
not  O
much  O
introduction  O
since  O
its  O
a  O
popular  O
local  O
dessert  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
hope  O
that  O
there  O
were  O
more  O
chunky  O
mango  O
flesh  O
to  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
sweet  O
finishing  O
.  O

Tonic  O
Medlar  O
&  O
Osmanthus  O
Cake  O
4/5  O

The  O
Tonic  O
Medlar  O
&  O
Osmanthus  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
is  O
still  O
as  O
good  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
had  O
it  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
subtle  O
,  O
gelatinous  O
and  O
not  O
overpowering  O
sweet  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
actually  O
glad  O
to  O
see  O
that  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
has  O
bring  O
its  O
famed  O
dim  O
sum  O
and  O
probably  O
the  O
cheapest  O
Michelin  O
Star  O
restaurant  O
to  O
the  O
heartland  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
second  O
outlet  O
,  O
hopefully  O
the  O
crowd  O
will  O
be  O
thinner  O
and  O
more  O
people  O
can  O
enjoy  O
the  O
delectable  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

Look  O
out  O
for  O
the  O
third  O
outlet  O
that  O
will  O
be  O
opening  O
in  O
Bedok  O

Rochor  O
Thai  O
is  O
the  O
new  O
kid  O
on  O
the  O
block  O
at  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
Road  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
it  O
has  O
taken  O
over  O
the  O
former  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O
unit  O
injecting  O
some  O
hot  O
spicy  O
competition  O
to  O
the  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
area  O
which  O
already  O
housed  O
many  O
restaurants  O
and  O
eateries  O
.  O

Rochor  O
Thai  O
is  O
not  O
new  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
scene  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
formerly  O
located  O
at  O
Rochor  O
Centre  O
before  O
shifting  O
to  O
the  O
current  O
premise  O
.  O

We  O
started  O
off  O
with  O
the  O
Pandan  O
infused  O
Lemongrass  O
drink  O
.  O

A  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
drink  O
that  O
is  O
just  O
perfect  O
for  O
the  O
hot  O
afternoon  O
.  O

Amuse  O
Bouche  O
4/5  O

I  O
am  O
actually  O
quite  O
taken  O
back  O
that  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Amuse  O
Bouche  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
not  O
expecting  O
it  O
from  O
a  O
casual  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
the  O
Amuse  O
Bouche  O
nicely  O
showcases  O
the  O
4  O
different  O
tastes  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
enjoyed  O
at  O
Rochor  O
Thai  O
.  O

Som  O

The  O
central  O

style  O
green  O
papaya  O
salad  O
,  O
Som  O
Tum  O
(  O
$  O
6.80  O
)  O
was  O
bursting  O
with  O
different  O
tastes  O
coming  O
together  O
making  O
a  O
beautiful  O
dish  O
.  O

Be  O
warned  O
that  O
the  O
refreshing  O
salad  O
packed  O
a  O
fiery  O
punch  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Lending  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
is  O
the  O
shredded  O
unripe  O
papaya  O
.  O

Pao  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Pla  O
Nin  O
Pao  O
(  O
$  O
22.80  O
)  O
reminded  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
salted  O
crusted  O
whole  O
tilapia  O
which  O
I  O
had  O
along  O
the  O
street  O
of  O
Thailand  O
,  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
spicy  O
garlic  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
at  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Instead  O
of  O
being  O
grilled  O
on  O
charcoal  O
like  O
the  O
street  O
stalls  O
in  O
Thailand  O
,  O
it  O
's  O
oven  O
baked  O
at  O
Rochor  O
Thai  O
.  O

The  O
tilapia  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
perfectly  O
cooked  O
without  O
that  O
muddy  O
taste  O
.  O

Po  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
Po  O
Taek  O
(  O

which  O
is  O
a  O
clear  O
hot  O
sour  O
soup  O
with  O
holy  O
basil  O
and  O
kaffir  O
lime  O
leaves  O
.  O

The  O
well  O
balanced  O
hot  O
and  O
sour  O
broth  O
was  O
an  O
delightful  O
enjoyment  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
fresh  O
seafood  O
.  O

Tom  O

Talay  O
4/5  O

The  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Talay  O
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
with  O
its  O
fiery  O
appearance  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
hot  O
and  O
spicy  O
as  O
it  O
looked  O
.  O

It  O
still  O
tasted  O
delicious  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
clear  O
soup  O
base  O
to  O
this  O
for  O
the  O
stronger  O
spicy  O
kick  O
.  O

Kor  O

4.2/5  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photo  O
,  O
the  O
grilled  O
pork  O
collar  O
was  O
cooked  O
beautifully  O
with  O
the  O
meat  O
still  O
having  O
a  O
shade  O
of  O
pink  O
.  O

The  O
Kor  O
Moo  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Green  O
curry  O
in  O

is  O
actually  O
not  O
spicy  O
but  O
more  O
on  O
the  O
sweet  O
side  O
.  O

The  O

for  O
me  O

Chee  O
Curry  O
,  O
Gaeng  O
Chu  O
Chee  O
Neua  O
(  O
$  O
18.80  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointing  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
there  O
,  O
the  O
beef  O
was  O
tad  O
tough  O
.  O

The  O
shin  O
cut  O
needs  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
time  O
for  O
the  O
tissues  O
to  O
break  O
down  O
more  O
.  O

Pad  O
Kee  O
Mao  O
Goong  O
(  O

)  O
translated  O
as  O
stir  O
fried  O
Thai  O
drunken  O
style  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
nothing  O
alcohol  O
about  O
the  O
dish  O
but  O
got  O
the  O
name  O
from  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
dish  O
originated  O
in  O
the  O
wee  O
hours  O
of  O
the  O
morning  O
after  O
a  O
merrymaking  O
night  O
at  O
the  O

pretty  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
a  O

more  O
pieces  O
of  O
it  O

,  O
Khai  O
Niew  O
Ma  O
Muang  O
(  O
$  O

is  O
a  O
staple  O
Thai  O
dessert  O
that  O
is  O
must  O
order  O
in  O
every  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
version  O
at  O
Rochor  O
Thai  O
has  O
the  O
mango  O
diced  O
into  O
cubes  O
for  O
easy  O
consumption  O
and  O
sharing  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
topping  O
of  O
mung  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
giving  O
it  O
an  O
extra  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Manted  O
Chuame  O
3/5  O

The  O
Manted  O
Chuame  O
had  O
me  O
salivating  O
and  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
dig  O
in  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
candied  O
cassava  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
soft  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
like  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
known  O
of  O
Thai  O
restaurants  O
adjusting  O
the  O
authentic  O
recipes  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

While  O
this  O
make  O
commercial  O
sense  O
,  O
it  O
lost  O
that  O
authentic  O
flavours  O
.  O

At  O
Rochor  O
Thai  O
,  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
the  O
kitchen  O
has  O
not  O
ready  O
tweaked  O
the  O
recipe  O
,  O
striving  O
to  O
bring  O
the  O
authenticity  O
flavours  O
to  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

While  O
this  O
is  O
appreciated  O
in  O
my  O
meal  O
,  O
I  O
noted  O
the  O
pricing  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
higher  O
compare  O
to  O
other  O
Thai  O
restaurants  O

I  O
have  O
booked  O
the  O
studio  O
deluxe  O
room  O
which  O
is  O
about  O
36sqm  O
for  O
my  O

There  O

Cooking  O

The  O
toilet  O
does  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
a  O
bath  O
tub  O
but  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
complaining  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
spacious  O
and  O
clean  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
important  O
.  O

Toilet  O
amenities  O
such  O
as  O

,  O
shower  O
gel  O
,  O
shampoo  O
and  O

outside  O
the  O

,  O
many  O
may  O
not  O
know  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
perfect  O
hotel  O
for  O

.  O

Depending  O
on  O
the  O
time  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
,  O
the  O
is  O
the  O

where  O
you  O
will  O
see  O
the  O

The  O
bedroom  O
at  O
Capri  O

Fraser  O
Changi  O
City  O
Singapore  O
is  O
very  O
comfortable  O
too  O
.  O

Picking  O
the  O
bone  O
,  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
like  O
the  O
tv  O

Although  O

I  O
love  O

would  O

recommend  O
my  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
an  O
Indian  O
restaurant  O
inside  O
the  O
Costa  O
Rhu  O
Condominium  O
's  O
Clubhouse  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
really  O
curious  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
what  O
sort  O
of  O
restaurant  O
has  O
decided  O
to  O
be  O
nestled  O
in  O
the  O
Tanjong  O
Rhu  O
area  O
surrounded  O
by  O
block  O
after  O
block  O
of  O
condominium  O
apartments  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
who  O
in  O
the  O
public  O
would  O
have  O
thought  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
an  O
Indian  O
restaurant  O
inside  O
a  O
condominium  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
open  O
to  O
the  O
public  O
.  O

Vatan  O
Se  O
is  O
a  O
small  O
homely  O
Indian  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
who  O
used  O
to  O
be  O
an  O
architect  O
decided  O
to  O
quit  O
his  O
job  O
and  O
pursue  O
his  O
passion  O
for  O
cooking  O
and  O
eating  O
.  O

Vante  O
Se  O
strives  O
to  O
bring  O
to  O
its  O
customers  O
food  O
from  O
home  O
,  O
just  O
the  O
way  O
one  O
would  O
cook  O
their  O
food  O
at  O
home  O
.  O

The  O
food  O
is  O
cooked  O
with  O
minimum  O
oil  O
and  O
uses  O
the  O
best  O
available  O
ingredients  O
.  O

No  O
artificial  O
red  O
and  O
orange  O
food  O
colourings  O
or  O
MSG  O
were  O
used  O
in  O
the  O
cooking  O
.  O

Papadum  O
with  O
Mint  O
Sauce  O
3.5/5  O

Complimentary  O
Papadum  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
mint  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
while  O
the  O
kitchen  O
prepares  O
your  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
idea  O
that  O
the  O
papad  O
is  O
folded  O
into  O
a  O
corn  O
shape  O
so  O
we  O
can  O
get  O
that  O
cracking  O
sound  O
when  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
break  O
it  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
mint  O

It  O
just  O
shows  O
that  O
the  O
papadum  O
was  O
freshly  O
made  O
.  O

Chaat  O
Papri  O
4/5  O

A  O
popular  O
Indian  O
street  O
food  O
,  O
the  O
Chaat  O
Papri  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
definitely  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
.  O

It  O
looked  O
quite  O
messy  O
in  O
appearance  O
but  O
the  O
mixture  O
of  O
mint  O
,  O
yogurt  O
,  O
coriander  O
and  O
crisp  O
fried  O
dough  O
wafers  O
was  O
bursting  O
with  O
an  O
array  O
of  O
beautiful  O
flavours  O
working  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

Tikka  O
Platter  O
4/5  O

To  O
showcases  O
the  O
delectable  O
food  O
prepared  O
by  O
the  O
Tandoor  O
(  O
a  O
cylindrical  O
clay  O
oven  O
)  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Ajwaini  O
Paneer  O
Tikka  O
(  O
$  O
11  O
for  O
full  O
portion  O
)  O
,  O
Achari  O
Fish  O
Tikka  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
for  O
full  O
portion  O
)  O
,  O
Mutton  O
Seekh  O
Kebah  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
for  O
full  O
portion  O
)  O
and  O
Kali  O
Mirchi  O
Chicken  O
Tikka  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
for  O
full  O
portion  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
beauty  O
of  O
cooking  O
with  O
Tandoor  O
is  O
that  O
it  O
uses  O
the  O
radiant  O
heat  O
of  O
the  O
charcoal  O
to  O
cook  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
locking  O
the  O
juiciness  O
of  O
the  O
meat  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
being  O
fragrant  O
by  O
the  O
smokey  O
charcoal  O
fire  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
platter  O
was  O
the  O
Kali  O
Mirchi  O
Chicken  O
Tikka  O
and  O
Ajwaini  O
Paneer  O
Tikka  O

that  O
not  O

make  O
Roomali  O
or  O
Rumali  O

It  O
is  O
basically  O
a  O
thin  O
flatbread  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
delectable  O

have  O
to  O
say  O
the  O

)  O
a  O
type  O
of  O

cream  O
dessert  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
already  O
very  O
full  O
after  O

heavy  O
meal  O
but  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
resist  O
finishing  O
the  O
kesar  O
kulfi  O
.  O

The  O
ice  O
cream  O
was  O
extremely  O
sweet  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
because  O
it  O
was  O
drenched  O
in  O
condense  O
milk  O
sauce  O
and  O
topped  O

All  O
my  O
favourite  O

my  O
meal  O
,  O
the  O

showed  O
me  O
a  O
rectangular  O
box  O
filled  O
with  O
colourful  O
spices  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
to  O
grab  O
a  O
mouthful  O
and  O
pop  O
inside  O
my  O
mouth  O
to  O
chew  O
on  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
actually  O
quite  O
interesting  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
like  O
mouthwash  O
and  O
the  O
spices  O
help  O
to  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

I  O
like  O

his  O
food  O

it  O
was  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
lightly  O
breaded  O
the  O
pork  O
chop  O
was  O
not  O
selling  O
the  O
limelight  O
from  O
the  O
meat  O
but  O
still  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
contrast  O
in  O
texture  O

with  O
a  O

kick  O
from  O
the  O

that  O
was  O
coated  O

I  O
was  O
delighted  O
to  O
see  O
freshly  O
made  O
Shrimps  O
and  O
Pork  O
Balls  O
being  O
served.I  O
love  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
chestnut  O
was  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
pork  O
balls  O
giving  O
it  O
an  O
extra  O
crunchy  O
bite  O

We  O
have  O
the  O

has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
health  O
benefits  O
.  O

We  O
also  O

For  O
the  O
seafood  O
,  O
we  O
had  O
Prawn  O
and  O
Turbot  O
Platter  O
as  O
stated  O
in  O
the  O
$  O
78++  O
set  O

.  O

However  O
I  O
doubt  O
the  O
fish  O
is  O
turbot  O
,  O
it  O
looked  O
more  O
like  O
grouper  O
from  O
its  O
appearance  O
and  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
prawn  O
and  O
fish  O
were  O
cooked  O
in  O
the  O

For  O
meat  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O

I  O
thought  O
they  O

too  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
to  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
enjoy  O
it  O
to  O
the  O
fullest  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
succulent  O
kurobuta  O
pork  O
,  O
the  O
beef  O
was  O
overcooked  O
and  O
tough  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

after  O
all  O

I  O
missed  O
the  O
fun  O
of  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
doing  O
my  O
blog  O
post  O
research  O
on  O
restaurants  O
that  O
started  O
business  O
in  O
the  O
1960s  O
for  O
my  O
OMY  O
Blog  O
Award  O
2013article  O
,  O
I  O
get  O
to  O
know  O
Hillman  O
Restaurant  O
which  O
started  O
business  O
in  O
1963  O
.  O

Founded  O
by  O
the  O
late  O
Mr  O
Wong  O
Lin  O
Ooh  O
and  O
Madam  O
Chan  O
Ah  O
Chee  O
located  O
along  O
Cantonment  O
Road  O
(  O
now  O
the  O
Pinnacle  O
at  O
Duxton  O
)  O
serving  O
Cantonese  O
Claypot  O
cuisines  O
before  O
moving  O
to  O
the  O
current  O
location  O
in  O
2003  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
has  O
won  O
many  O
recognition  O
and  O
awards  O
in  O
the  O
culinary  O
industry  O
and  O
it  O
is  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
full  O
house  O
on  O
a  O
weekday  O
night  O
.  O

Without  O
prior  O
reservation  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
lucky  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
table  O
for  O
3  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
that  O
we  O
are  O

only  O
Singaporean  O

the  O
restaurant  O

the  O
rest  O
will  O

I  O
also  O
realised  O
that  O
the  O
menu  O
comes  O
in  O
Japanese  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
table  O
ordered  O
similar  O
dishes  O
.  O

Looks  O
like  O

restaurant  O
is  O
quite  O
popular  O
among  O

served  O
with  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
lettuce  O
which  O
was  O
seem  O
in  O
almost  O
every  O
table  O
.  O

To  O
eat  O
it  O
,  O
pick  O
up  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
fried  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
,  O
wrapped  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
lettuce  O
and  O
eat  O
it  O
together  O
.  O

While  O
it  O
is  O
an  O
unique  O
experience  O
piecing  O
the  O
different  O
ingredients  O
together  O
,  O
flavour  O

nothing  O
near  O
to  O

that  O

was  O
nothing  O
fancy  O
just  O
homely  O
cooked  O
food  O
that  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

Maybe  O
I  O
was  O
unfortunate  O
cause  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
find  O
any  O
mushroom  O
in  O
my  O
omelette  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
as  O
cheesy  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
have  O
like  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
of  O
Signature  O
Stone  O
Restaurant  O
is  O
their  O
version  O
of  O
claypot  O
rice  O
using  O
stone  O
pot  O
.  O

To  O
suit  O
the  O
palate  O
of  O
the  O
younger  O
generation  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
introduced  O
a  O
western  O
version  O
of  O
claypot  O
rice  O
such  O
as  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Ham  O
&  O
Cheese  O
Rice  O
,  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Lemony  O
Scallop  O
and  O
many  O
more  O
.  O

The  O
stone  O
pot  O
serving  O
is  O
for  O
individual  O
portion  O
.  O

Upon  O
serving  O
,  O
the  O
server  O
will  O
drizzle  O
some  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
over  O
the  O
rice  O
and  O
fold  O
it  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
prefer  O
your  O
rice  O
to  O
be  O
darker  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Stone  O
Pot  O
Garlic  O
Herb  O
Salmon  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
western  O
flavour  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Garlic  O
Herb  O
Salmon  O
(  O
$  O
12.30  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
choice  O
with  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
garlic  O
instantly  O
hit  O
the  O
nostrils  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
an  O
advantage  O
of  O
using  O
stone  O
pot  O
over  O
claypot  O
cause  O
you  O
get  O
layers  O
after  O
layers  O
of  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
rice  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

The  O
first  O
fold  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
brings  O
the  O
burnt  O
rice  O
to  O
the  O
top  O
.  O

While  O
eating  O
the  O
top  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
is  O
still  O
cooking  O
the  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
.  O

Hence  O
when  O
we  O
fold  O
again  O
,  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
enjoy  O
another  O
layer  O
of  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
rice  O
.  O

Stone  O
Pot  O
Sliced  O
Pork  O
with  O
Salted  O
Fish  O
4/5  O

For  O
a  O
taste  O
of  O
tradition  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Sliced  O
Pork  O
with  O
Salted  O
Fish  O
(  O
$  O
8.20  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
sliced  O
pork  O
,  O
chinese  O
sausages  O
,  O
mushroom  O
and  O
salted  O
fish  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
beside  O
the  O
salted  O
fish  O
in  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
,  O
it  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
separate  O
saucer  O
with  O
finely  O
diced  O
salted  O
fish  O
to  O
be  O
pour  O
and  O
mixed  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
so  O
each  O
mouthful  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
good  O
blend  O
of  O
salted  O
fish  O
,  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
rice  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
Signature  O
Stone  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

However  O
for  O
an  O
individual  O
stone  O
pot  O
serving  O
portion  O
,  O
I  O
think  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
pricey.Probably  O
they  O
can  O
provide  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
ingredients  O
for  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
so  O
that  O
it  O
gives  O
the  O
customer  O
an  O
impression  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
getting  O
value  O
in  O
return  O
.  O

was  O
presented  O
in  O
a  O
short  O
glass  O
.  O

The  O
shiraou  O
was  O
rather  O
fat  O
and  O
beautifully  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
flavourful  O
shoyu  O
sauce  O
.  O

Moving  O
on  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Oyster  O
in  O
Mayonnaise  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
smoky  O
torched  O
mayonnaise  O
taste  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
too  O
overpowering  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
oyster  O
.  O

Lastly  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Pitan  O
Tofu  O
which  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
all  O
time  O
favourites  O
in  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

While  O
century  O
egg  O
maybe  O
an  O
acquire  O
taste  O
for  O
some  O
,  O
I  O
simply  O
adored  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
creamy  O
century  O
egg  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
chilled  O
tofu  O
.  O

Sashimi  O

The  O
plate  O
of  O
Sashimi  O
(  O

)  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
freshest  O
Hamachi  O
,  O
Salmon  O
,  O
Toro  O
Belly  O
and  O
Botan  O
Ebi  O
for  O
the  O
day  O
.  O

The  O
Botan  O
Ebi  O
stood  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
with  O
its  O
sweetness  O
and  O
freshness  O
.  O

Gras  O

The  O

Foie  O
Gras  O
(  O

was  O
an  O
exquisite  O
execution  O
from  O
Chef  O
Li-san  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
Hamachi  O
is  O
wrapped  O
with  O

,  O
topped  O
with  O
shaved  O
truffle  O
and  O
seaweed  O
covered  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
sheet  O
of  O
crunchy  O
seaweed  O
and  O
plated  O
on  O
a  O
sakura  O
leaf  O
.  O

Amazingly  O
everything  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
is  O
edible  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
dish  O
is  O
rather  O
oily  O
,  O
the  O
sakaru  O
leaf  O
helped  O
to  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Imo  O
Manjyu  O

Deep  O
fried  O
to  O

The  O
delectable  O

chunky  O

that  O
is  O

A  O

in  O
Singapore  O
where  O
the  O
Burrata  O
Mozzarella  O
(  O

)  O

Kamut  O
Spaghetti  O
4/5  O

The  O
Spaghetti  O
(  O
$  O
36  O
)  O
at  O
Il  O
Cielo  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
the  O
rare  O
kamut  O
flour  O
.  O

Kamut  O
is  O
not  O
the  O
name  O
of  O
the  O
wheat  O
but  O
a  O
trademark  O
.  O

The  O
Khorasan  O
wheat  O
is  O
an  O
ancient  O
type  O
of  O
grain  O
organically  O
grown  O
,  O
believed  O
to  O
have  O
originated  O
from  O
Egypt  O
.  O

The  O
al  O

spaghetti  O
was  O
cooked  O
with  O
sicilian  O
red  O
prawn  O
,  O
zucchini  O
and  O
caviar  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
hearty  O
and  O
homely  O

with  O
a  O
modernised  O
execution  O
.  O

Branzino  O

The  O
Branzino  O
(  O

)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
whole  O
sea  O
bass  O
flash  O
roasted  O
on  O
olive  O
wood  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
is  O
served  O
whole  O
and  O
deboned  O
at  O
table  O
side  O
by  O
the  O
waiter  O
.  O

The  O
sea  O
bass  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
earthy  O
aroma  O
.  O

Agnello  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Agnello  O
(  O
$  O
50  O
)  O
is  O
cooked  O
to  O
medium  O
exactly  O
what  O
we  O
have  O
ordered  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O
olive  O
crusted  O
colorado  O
rack  O
of  O
lamb  O
was  O
beautiful  O
and  O
paired  O
with  O
excellently  O
with  O
the  O
truffle  O
mustard  O
.  O

Tortino  O
Al  O
Cioccolato  O
3/5  O

The  O
Tortino  O
Al  O
Cioccolata  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
was  O
rather  O
misleading  O
.  O

The  O
Amadel  O
Dark  O
Chocolate  O
Souffle  O
was  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
molten  O
lava  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
rather  O
than  O
a  O
souffle  O
.  O

The  O
accompanying  O
spicy  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
,  O
creamy  O
and  O
smooth  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
tad  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Overall  O
the  O
most  O
memorable  O
experience  O
is  O
the  O
cosy  O
,  O
intimate  O
and  O

ambience  O
of  O

Tiramisu  O
(  O

)  O
is  O
laced  O
with  O
a  O
combination  O
of  O
orange  O
liqueur  O
and  O
cognac  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
a  O
strong  O
alcohol  O
bitterness  O
that  O
was  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
cherry  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
a  O
much  O
stronger  O
flavour  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
3  O
tiramsu  O
I  O
tried  O
.  O

This  O
will  O
be  O
well  O
received  O
with  O
those  O
that  O
like  O
their  O
tiramisu  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
strong  O
liqueur  O
content  O
.  O

If  O
the  O
dark  O

is  O

The  O
classic  O
tiramsu  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
smooth  O
and  O
creamy  O
coupled  O
with  O
aromatic  O
coffee  O
soaked  O

.  O

By  O
the  O
way  O
,  O
the  O

used  O
to  O

may  O
not  O
be  O
new  O
but  O
the  O
version  O
at  O
L'Atelier  O
TiramiSu  O
is  O
laced  O
with  O
dark  O

.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
green  O
tea  O
soaked  O
biscuit  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
creamy  O
lightness  O
of  O
the  O
cake  O
was  O
a  O
delightful  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
others  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
fruity  O
Lychee  O
Tiramisu  O
(  O
slice  O

,  O
cake  O

)  O
which  O
is  O
laced  O
with  O
Lychee  O
liqueur  O
and  O
vodka  O
,  O
it  O
fell  O
just  O
short  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
liqueur  O
content  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
too  O
much  O
.  O

It  O
shadowed  O
the  O
refreshing  O
fruity  O
lychee  O
flavour  O
I  O
was  O
expecting  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
that  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
reasons  O
why  O
there  O
are  O
different  O
flavours  O
to  O
suit  O
each  O
individual  O

palate  O

never  O
noticed  O
this  O

at  O

surviving  O

in  O

from  O

Recently  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
going  O
to  O
The  O
Grandstand  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
noticed  O
a  O
crowd  O
at  O
the  O
Indian  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Curry  O
Garden  O
.  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
recent  O
visit  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
since  O
the  O
restaurant  O
always  O
has  O
a  O
constant  O
flow  O
of  O
customers  O
.  O

Actually  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
lost  O
in  O
what  O
to  O
order  O
so  O
I  O
just  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
section  O
and  O
ordered  O
from  O
there  O
.  O

Mango  O
Lassi  O
4/5  O

While  O
waiting  O
for  O
my  O
meal  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
a  O
Mango  O
Lassi  O
to  O
start  O
with  O
.  O

Lassi  O
is  O
a  O
traditional  O
yogurt  O
based  O
drink  O
originating  O
from  O
India  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
lassi  O
blended  O
with  O
yogurt  O
,  O
water  O
and  O
mango  O
pulp  O
was  O
cooling  O
,  O
soothing  O
and  O
perfect  O
compliment  O
for  O
the  O
spicy  O
food  O
.  O

Garlic  O
Naan  O
Chicken  O
Set  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Garlic  O
Naan  O
Chicken  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
2  O
pieces  O
of  O
garlic  O
naan  O
cut  O
into  O
4  O
pieces  O
,  O
curry  O
and  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
butter  O
chicken  O
or  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
but  O
I  O
order  O
another  O
serving  O
of  O
mutton  O
masala  O
.  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
resist  O
ordering  O
the  O
mutton  O
masala  O
after  O
noticing  O
the  O
next  O
table  O
having  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
was  O
too  O
dry  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
naan  O
,  O
mutton  O
masala  O
is  O
better  O
option  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
did  O
not  O
like  O
the  O
curry  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
cold  O
.  O

Batura  O
Set  O
Chicken  O
3.8/5  O

My  O
partner  O
ordered  O
the  O
Batura  O
Chicken  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
with  O
butter  O
chicken  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
batura  O
and  O
we  O
were  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
the  O
huge  O
puffed  O
bread  O
made  O
from  O
maida  O
flour  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

We  O
are  O
also  O
surprised  O
that  O
the  O
butter  O
chicken  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
gravy  O
,  O
we  O
thought  O
they  O
have  O
served  O
us  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
instead  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
patrons  O
ordered  O
their  O
curry  O
fish  O
head  O
,  O
I  O
should  O
try  O
to  O
have  O
them  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

The  O
naan  O
is  O
pretty  O
good  O
too  O
but  O
I  O
will  O
prefer  O
the  O
mutton  O
masala  O
to  O
the  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
or  O
butter  O
chicken  O

Located  O
at  O

of  O
the  O
stretch  O
of  O

facing  O
the  O
main  O

this  O
ode  O
charm  O
classic  O
English  O
Steakhouse  O
,  O
Fosters  O
Steakhouse  O
since  O
1960  O
.  O

Fosters  O
Steakhouse  O
was  O
first  O
established  O
at  O
25  O
Amber  O
Mansion  O
of  O
old  O
Orchard  O
.  O

Moving  O
another  O
2  O
times  O
to  O
Specialists  O
Shopping  O
Centre  O
and  O
Palais  O
Renaissance  O
before  O
settling  O
down  O
at  O
the  O
current  O
venue  O
.  O

Upon  O
settling  O
down  O
,  O
warm  O
breads  O
were  O
served  O
.  O

After  O
browsing  O
through  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
lunch  O
set  O
menu  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
soup  O
,  O
mains  O
,  O
a  O

of  O

at  O
$  O
17.90++  O

Mushroom  O
Soup  O
3.5/5  O
and  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

Both  O
the  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
and  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
were  O
comforting  O
and  O
homely  O
.  O

Compared  O
the  O
two  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
the  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
flavourful  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
caramelised  O
onion  O
.  O

Fillet  O
Steak  O
4/5  O

There  O
were  O
5  O
choices  O
for  O
main  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Fillet  O
Steak  O
which  O
was  O
grilled  O
tenderloin  O
served  O
with  O
chestnut  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chestnut  O
sauce  O
sounds  O
interesting  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
not  O
really  O
noticeable  O
.  O

The  O
fillet  O
inself  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
.  O

Combo  O
Grill  O
3.8/5  O

Similar  O
plating  O
of  O
mash  O
potatoes  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
and  O
carrot  O
was  O
used  O
for  O
the  O
Combo  O
Grill  O
.  O

The  O
platter  O
of  O
beef  O
steak  O
,  O
chicken  O
and  O
salmon  O
fillet  O
served  O
with  O
mushroom  O
sauce  O
was  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
beef  O
and  O
chicken  O
were  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
,  O
the  O
salmon  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
over  O
cooked  O
and  O
dry  O
.  O

Coffee  O

The  O
lunch  O
set  O
menu  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
Coffee  O
or  O
Tea  O
.  O

We  O
are  O
both  O
coffee  O
drinker  O
so  O
inevitable  O
our  O
choice  O
is  O
not  O
quite  O
difficult  O
.  O

Apple  O
Strudel  O
with  O
Vanilla  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
3/5  O

The  O
dessert  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
was  O
Apple  O
Strudel  O
with  O
Vanilla  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
.  O

A  O
simple  O
sweet  O
ending  O
for  O
lunch  O
.  O

While  O
dining  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
I  O
noticed  O
there  O
were  O
many  O
awards  O
and  O
write  O
ups  O
being  O
framed  O
and  O
hanged  O
on  O
the  O
walls  O
.  O

It  O
seems  O
like  O
Fosters  O
Steakhouse  O
is  O
quite  O
renowned  O
for  O
serving  O
quality  O
and  O
delish  O
steak  O
and  O
great  O
rendition  O
of  O
the  O
English  O
classics  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
lunch  O
set  O
is  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
,  O
I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
wish  O

3  O
minutes  O
.  O


A  O
month  O
has  O
flown  O
by  O
and  O
its  O
Makansutra  O
dinner  O
for  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
July  O
2013  O
.  O

This  O
time  O
the  O
dinner  O
was  O
at  O
The  O
Grandstand  O
and  O
its  O
my  O
first  O
Japanese  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
besides  O
the  O
regulars  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
Karen  O
,  O
Philip  O
and  O
Serene  O
joining  O
us  O
this  O
time  O
.  O

Pitan  O
Tofu  O
4.2/5  O

As  O
usual  O
dinner  O
started  O
quite  O
late  O
at  O
8pm  O
.  O

We  O
started  O
the  O
10  O
course  O
meal  O
with  O
Pitan  O
Tofu  O
.  O

It  O
reminded  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
same  O
dish  O
I  O
had  O
many  O
years  O
ago  O
which  O
brought  O
back  O
many  O
memories  O
.  O

Enhanced  O
by  O
the  O
century  O
egg  O
,  O
the  O
combination  O
was  O
a  O
delightful  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
texture  O
and  O
flavour  O
.  O

Nama  O
Kaki  O
Ponzu  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Fin  O
De  O
Claire  O
Oyster  O
with  O
Ponzu  O
Sauce  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
bursting  O
with  O
the  O
delightful  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
sea  O
.  O

Fugu  O
Mirin  O
Boshi  O
4/5  O

When  O
the  O
Fugu  O
Mirin  O
Boshi  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
everyone  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
guess  O
what  O
it  O
is  O
?  O

The  O
taste  O
and  O
texture  O
which  O
resembles  O
the  O
Bak  O
Kwa  O
is  O
actually  O
dried  O
puffer  O
fish  O
seasoned  O
with  O
sweet  O
sake  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
tradtional  O
snack  O
eaten  O
while  O
drinking  O
sake  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
tried  O
the  O
dried  O
puffer  O
fish  O
before  O
in  O
my  O
previous  O
experience  O
at  O
Seki  O
Japanese  O
Restaurant  O
which  O
unfortunately  O
has  O
closed  O
its  O
door  O
.  O

Sashimi  O
Moriawase  O
4/5  O

The  O
Sashimi  O
Moriawase  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
6  O
kinds  O
of  O
fresh  O
sashimi  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
assorted  O
sashimi  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
squid  O
with  O
stuffed  O
roe  O
was  O
interesting  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
that  O
came  O
with  O
popping  O
surprises  O
.  O

Tenderloin  O
Teppanyaki  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Tenderloin  O
Teppanyaki  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
Australian  O
beef  O
with  O
homemade  O
apple  O
sauce  O
was  O
pan  O
fried  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
bursting  O
with  O
flavours  O
.  O

Makimono  O
Moriawase  O
3/5  O

The  O
Makimono  O
Moriawase  O
was  O
a  O
welcome  O
trio  O
of  O
carbohydrates  O
to  O
satisfy  O
the  O
hungry  O
stomach  O
.  O

Ebi  O
Kawari  O
Mayonnaise  O
Ae  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Ebi  O
Kawari  O
Maonnaise  O
Ae  O
was  O
another  O
lovely  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
marinated  O
prawn  O
fritters  O
was  O
crunchy  O
and  O
coated  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
garlic  O
sauce  O
.  O

Toro  O
no  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Miso  O
Yaki  O
3.5/5  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
dish  O
that  O
everyone  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
but  O
the  O
Toro  O
no  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Miso  O
Yaki  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
excellent  O
individually  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
fatty  O
tuna  O
was  O
overpowered  O
by  O
the  O
strong  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
,  O
duck  O
liver  O
and  O
miso  O
sauce  O
when  O
eaten  O
together  O
.  O

Truffle  O
Inaniwa  O
Udon  O
2.8/5  O

The  O
Truffle  O
Inaniwa  O
Udon  O
was  O
an  O
interesting  O
concept  O
but  O
the  O
signature  O
Japanese  O
wheat  O
noodle  O
was  O
totally  O
drown  O
by  O
the  O
black  O
pepper  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
much  O
that  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
even  O
taste  O
the  O
truffle  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
wheat  O
noodle  O
was  O
lumpy  O
and  O
chewy  O
that  O
was  O
not  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Homemade  O
Japanese  O
Tofu  O
Cheesecake  O

I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
about  O
IndoChili  O
after  O
reading  O
the  O
good  O
review  O
at  O
Maureen  O
's  O
blog  O
.  O

I  O
finally  O
got  O
my  O
chance  O
to  O
make  O
my  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
Zion  O
Road  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
restaurant  O
that  O
was  O
opened  O
last  O
year  O
serving  O
authentic  O
Indonesian  O
cuisine  O
at  O
Zion  O
Road  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
just  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
stretch  O
of  O
shop  O
houses  O
opposite  O
Great  O
World  O
City  O
or  O
beside  O
Zion  O
Riverside  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
transported  O
to  O
Java  O
with  O
its  O
woodcraft  O
decor  O
and  O
traditional  O
music  O
playing  O
in  O
the  O
background  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
owned  O
by  O
the  O
Java  O
Kitchen  O
Group  O
which  O
has  O
13  O
casual  O
eateries  O
in  O
Jakarta  O
and  O
5  O
nasi  O
padang  O
stalls  O
in  O
foodcourts  O
.  O

Jus  O
Alpukat  O
4/5  O

Lunch  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
complimentary  O
plate  O
of  O
keropok  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
a  O
varieties  O
of  O
it  O
however  O
inside  O
me  O
was  O
screaming  O
for  O
a  O
chilli  O
dip  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

Paired  O
with  O
a  O
glass  O
of  O
creamy  O
and  O
refreshing  O
Jus  O
Alpukat  O
(  O
$  O
6.80  O
)  O
,  O
fresh  O
avocado  O
juice  O
,  O
I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
lunch  O
.  O

Tahu  O
Telor  O
4.2/5  O

Initially  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
n't  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
presentation  O
of  O
the  O
Tahu  O
Telor  O
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
a  O
beancurd  O
tower  O
instead  O
of  O
pieces  O
of  O
beancurd  O
drenched  O
with  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
.  O

What  O
hit  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
unique  O
savoury  O
sweet  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
Tahu  O
Telor  O
sauce  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
spotted  O
an  O
interesting  O
white  O
ingredient  O
garnished  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
beancurd  O
omelette  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
raw  O
garlic  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
realised  O
it  O
was  O
baby  O
bean  O
sprout  O
head  O
which  O
they  O
painstakingly  O
peeled  O
after  O
checking  O
with  O
the  O
staff  O
.  O

Redang  O
Sapi  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Redang  O
Sapi  O
(  O
$  O
9.80  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
traditional  O
from  O
Minangkabau  O
,  O
West  O
Sumatra  O
.  O

The  O
fork  O
tender  O
beef  O
redang  O
was  O
slow  O
cooked  O
for  O
at  O
least  O
4  O
hours  O
packed  O
with  O
richness  O
of  O
the  O
spices  O
.  O

Ayam  O
Kari  O
Padang  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Padang  O
style  O
curry  O
chicken  O
,  O
Ayam  O
Kari  O
Padang  O
(  O
$  O
8.8  O
)  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
as  O
rich  O
or  O
spicy  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Indian  O
version  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
is  O
more  O
watered  O
down  O
with  O
a  O
strong  O
ginger  O
taste  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
actually  O
surprised  O
that  O
coconut  O
milk  O
was  O
added  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

For  O
diners  O
that  O
ca  O
n't  O
take  O
too  O
spicy  O
,  O
the  O
kari  O
ayam  O
will  O
be  O
easy  O
for  O
your  O
palate  O

4.5/5  O

A  O
must  O
order  O
at  O
IndonChili  O
is  O
the  O
Sop  O
Buntut  O
(  O
$  O
14.80  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
thick  O
and  O
yet  O
clear  O
broth  O
was  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
.  O

No  O
wonder  O
it  O
is  O
known  O
for  O
serving  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
oxtail  O
soups  O
in  O
Indonesia  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
learnt  O
from  O
my  O
Indonesian  O
friend  O
that  O
you  O
can  O
squeeze  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
lime  O
,  O
add  O
a  O
few  O
drops  O
of  O
sweet  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
mix  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
sambal  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
,  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
different  O
punch  O
.  O

and  O
Es  O
Teler  O
(  O

.  O

The  O
Es  O

was  O
really  O
good  O
with  O
the  O
mixture  O
of  O
pandan  O
jelly  O
coconut  O
milk  O
and  O
palm  O
sugar  O
.  O

Once  O

my  O
Indonesian  O
introduced  O
me  O
to  O
Es  O
Teler  O
during  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
Jakarta  O
trip  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
the  O
assorted  O
fruits  O
of  O
coconut  O
,  O
avocado  O
and  O
jackfruit  O
in  O
a  O
milky  O

good  O
as  O

Ordering  O
from  O
the  O

,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Canadian  O
Handpicked  O
Scallop  O
.  O

It  O
is  O

like  O
a  O

with  O
the  O

topped  O
with  O

better  O
with  O
the  O

While  O
others  O
find  O
the  O
Indo-China  O
Farmed  O
Duck  O
Breast  O
gamey  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
pinkish  O
sliced  O
duck  O
breast  O
was  O
excellently  O
executed  O
.  O

The  O
citrus  O
honey  O
glaze  O
did  O
bring  O
a  O
nice  O
contrast  O
of  O
the  O
flavours  O
but  O
I  O
preferred  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
reduction  O
of  O
it  O
for  O
the  O
meat  O
to  O
shine  O
.  O

Not  O

of  O
people  O
isAmaSoyincluding  O
myself  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
only  O
introduced  O
to  O
it  O
during  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
visit  O
to  O
DARNO  O
Japanese  O
Hotpot  O
by  O
MOF  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
dual  O
meaning  O
to  O
the  O
brand  O

,  O
Ama  O
which  O
means  O
Sweet  O
in  O
Japanese  O
and  O
also  O
Grandma  O
in  O
Chinese  O
.  O

The  O
founder  O
chanced  O
upon  O
this  O
delicious  O
Tounyu  O
Soy  O
Beancurd  O
reminiscent  O
the  O
Singapore  O
soy  O
beancurd  O
during  O
her  O
stay  O
in  O
Japan  O
and  O
the  O
taste  O
reminded  O
her  O
of  O
the  O
memories  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
growing  O
up  O
with  O
her  O
grandma  O
in  O
meager  O
conditions  O
.  O

Let  O
me  O
let  O
you  O
in  O
to  O
something  O
you  O
probably  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
.  O

AmaSoy  O
beancurd  O
recipe  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
Japanese  O
recipe  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
natural  O
compared  O
to  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
brands  O
that  O
uses  O
coffeemix  O
in  O
the  O
mixture  O
.  O

The  O
natural  O
and  O
nutritious  O
recipe  O
is  O
trans-fat  O

Recently  O
,  O
AmaSoy  O
has  O
improved  O
in  O
their  O
recipes  O
enhancing  O
the  O
Japanese  O
pudding  O
with  O
Collagen  O
and  O
Omega  O
3  O
(  O

)  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
popular  O
Original  O
,  O
Almond  O
and  O
Mango  O
beancurd  O
,  O
exciting  O
new  O
flavours  O
and  O
toppings  O
are  O
introduced  O
.  O

More  O
choices  O
and  O
selections  O
now  O
.  O

New  O
flavours  O
include  O
Matcha  O
and  O
Salted  O
Caramel  O
.  O

For  O
toppings  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
new  O
additions  O
such  O
as  O
red  O
bean  O
,  O
peanuts  O
,  O
gingko  O
nuts  O
,  O
lotus  O
seeds  O
,  O
aloe  O
vera  O
,  O
taro  O
and  O
strawberry  O
etc  O
.  O

So  O
why  O
do  O
I  O
prefer  O
AmaSoy  O
Japanese  O
pudding  O
or  O
beancurd  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
brand  O
?  O

First  O
of  O
all  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
other  O
brands  O
too  O
sweet  O
to  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

AmaSoy  O
beancurd  O
is  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
and  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Have  O
you  O
ever  O
left  O
your  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
beancurd  O
overnight  O
and  O
noticed  O
a  O
sheet  O
like  O
layer  O
thingy  O
on  O
the  O
surface  O
?  O

I  O

My  O
partner  O
was  O
telling  O
about  O
this  O
hawker  O
stall  O
at  O
Changi  O
Village  O
Food  O
Centre  O
that  O
was  O
featured  O
in  O
some  O
food  O
variety  O
stall  O
that  O
sells  O
quite  O
awesome  O
sambal  O
fish  O
head  O
.  O

Some  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
,  O
we  O
made  O
our  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
far  O
east  O
of  O
the  O
island  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Guang  O
Xing  O
Original  O

Fish  O
Head  O
Been  O
Hoon  O
(  O
)  O
stall  O
at  O
Changi  O
Village  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

A  O
long  O
queue  O
was  O
formed  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
wait  O
up  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
45  O
minutes  O
for  O
our  O
food  O
.  O

Sambal  O
Fish  O
Head  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Sambal  O
Fish  O
Head  O
(  O
$  O
10/15/20  O
)  O
is  O
the  O
reason  O
why  O
we  O
have  O
made  O
the  O
journey  O
to  O
the  O
far  O
east  O
.  O

This  O
fiery  O
looking  O
dish  O
packed  O
a  O
punch  O
and  O
will  O
set  O
your  O
mouth  O
on  O
fire  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
what  O
species  O
of  O
fish  O
the  O
stall  O
used  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

The  O
sambal  O
was  O
definitely  O
the  O
highlight  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O
delectable  O
fish  O
head  O
and  O
bitter  O
gourd  O
.  O

The  O
aroma  O
sambal  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
Hua  O
Tiao  O
wine  O
making  O
it  O
more  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
also  O
popular  O
for  O
its  O
Black  O
Bean  O
Sauce  O
Fish  O
Head  O
with  O
bitter  O
gourd  O
.  O

Fish  O
Soup  O
4.2/5  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
blessing  O
that  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Fish  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
from  O
the  O
stall  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
helped  O
to  O
cool  O
off  O
the  O
burning  O
tongue  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
soup  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
refreshing  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
slices  O
was  O
also  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O

All  O
these  O
while  O
I  O
have  O
read  O
good  O
reviews  O
on  O
Prego  O
at  O
Fairmont  O
Singapore  O
but  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
get  O
the  O
chance  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
food  O
until  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
new  O
look  O
menu  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
dining  O
experience  O
at  O
the  O
Italian  O
Trattoria  O
,  O
Chef  O
Antonio  O
Facchinetti  O
brings  O
to  O
diner  O
an  O
authentic  O
,  O
traditional  O
and  O
homely  O
Italian  O
cuisine  O
with  O
the  O
fresh  O
and  O
quality  O
ingredients  O
.  O

We  O
started  O
the  O
meal  O
with  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
bread  O
accompanied  O
by  O
seasonal  O
dips  O
.  O

From  O
left  O
to  O
right  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Tomato  O
with  O
Basil  O
,  O
Caramelized  O
Onion  O
with  O
Ricotta  O
Cheese  O
and  O
Truffle  O
with  O
Ricotta  O
Cheese  O
.  O

My  O
personal  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
three  O
is  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onion  O
with  O
ricotta  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
sweet  O
and  O
savoury  O
combination  O
worked  O
wonderfully  O
with  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
lending  O
a  O
delectable  O
bite  O
.  O

salad  O
,  O
radicchio  O
,  O
fennel  O
,  O
red  O
onion  O
and  O
lemon  O
dressing  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
appreciated  O
the  O
fresh  O
greens  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
zesty  O
lemon  O
dressing  O
to  O
live  O
up  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
salad  O
.  O

Stracciatell  O
di  O
Bufala  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Stracciatell  O

.  O

The  O
exquisite  O
dish  O
cleverly  O

together  O
.  O

pork  O
sausage  O
with  O
roasted  O
organic  O
sweet  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
sausage  O
did  O
resemble  O
the  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
familiar  O
to  O
my  O
Asian  O
palate  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
fatty  O
texture  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
,  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
roasted  O
organic  O
sweet  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
gave  O
the  O
needed  O
balance  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
which  O
I  O
applauded  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
also  O
went  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
bread  O
.  O

crumbs  O
,  O
chilli  O
,  O
black  O

and  O
fennel  O
.  O

An  O
interesting  O
pasta  O
dish  O
with  O
layers  O
of  O
textures  O
that  O
was  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
dish  O
getting  O
favourable  O
nods  O
from  O
the  O
table  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
like  O
my  O
pasta  O
with  O
sauce  O
.  O

that  O
is  O
aged  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
a  O

was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
with  O

The  O

basically  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
when  O
I  O
cut  O
into  O
it  O

The  O

Compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
beaches  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
Changi  O
Beach  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
quieter  O
of  O
the  O
lot  O
.  O

Little  O
did  O
I  O
know  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
bistro  O
,  O
Bistro  O
@  O
Changi  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
idyllic  O
stretch  O
of  O
sandy  O
Changi  O
Beach  O
Park  O
just  O
beside  O
the  O
PCN  O
Pitstop  O
or  O
bicycle  O
rental  O
kisok  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
day  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
relax  O
and  O
laze  O
at  O
the  O
alfresco  O
cafe  O
over  O
an  O
icy  O
beer  O
.  O

At  O
night  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
dine  O
under  O
stars  O
enjoying  O
the  O
sea  O
breeze  O
.  O

All  O
these  O
come  O
with  O
a  O
scenic  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
sea  O
,  O
ships  O
sailing  O
by  O
and  O
airplanes  O
touching  O
down  O
at  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
at  O
Bistro  O
@  O
Changi  O
on  O
a  O
weekend  O
around  O
530pm  O
.  O

We  O
started  O
with  O
some  O
ice  O
cold  O
beer  O
relaxing  O
and  O
enjoying  O
the  O
idyllic  O
surrounding  O
and  O
watching  O
airplanes  O
making  O
their  O
approach  O
to  O
land  O
.  O

Topshell  O
Salad  O
4/5  O

The  O
ideal  O
snack  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
beer  O
is  O
the  O
Topshell  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
refreshing  O
salad  O
was  O
tossed  O
with  O
fresh  O
onions  O
and  O
lettuce  O
,  O
dressed  O
in  O
chef  O
's  O
thai  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Topshell  O
itself  O
is  O
quite  O
bland  O
hence  O
the  O
sauce  O
plays  O
an  O
important  O
part  O
in  O
lifting  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
the  O
spicy  O
tangy  O
sauce  O
definitely  O
did  O
that  O
.  O

Calamari  O
3/5  O

Only  O
available  O
on  O
Thursday  O
and  O
Sunday  O
is  O
the  O
Calamari  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
fresh  O
and  O
crunchy  O
squid  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
batter  O
is  O
too  O
thick  O
to  O
allow  O
me  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
texture  O
.  O

Flame  O
Grilled  O
Chicken  O
Chop  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
crowd  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Flame  O
Grilled  O
Chicken  O
Chop  O
(  O
$  O
15.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
boneless  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
was  O
perfectly  O
grilled  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
beautifully  O
topped  O
with  O
the  O
delectable  O
hickery  O
barbeque  O
sauce  O
with  O
salad  O
and  O
baked  O
potato  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Barramundi  O
In  O
Thai  O
Sauce  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Barramundi  O
in  O
Thai  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
18.90  O
)  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
butter  O
rice  O
.  O

Light  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
yet  O
moist  O
in  O
the  O
inside  O
.  O

Topped  O
with  O
green  O
mango  O
and  O
Thai  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
further  O
enhanced  O
the  O
whole  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
fusion  O
twist  O
.  O

If  O

the  O

I  O
actually  O
wanted  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
popular  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
at  O
Clementi  O
Central  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
opened  O
hence  O
I  O
went  O
walked  O
over  O
to  O
Clementi  O
block  O
448  O
Market  O
and  O
Food  O
Centre  O
to  O
have  O
my  O
breakfast  O
instead  O
.  O

After  O
walking  O
around  O
the  O
food  O
centre  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
join  O
the  O
queue  O
at  O
Boon  O
Kee  O
Wanton  O
Noodle  O
for  O
my  O
breakfast  O
.  O

Wanton  O
Noodle  O
Dry  O
and  O
Soup  O

From  O
my  O
observation  O
,  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
family  O
run  O
stall  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
2  O
old  O
folks  O
that  O
is  O
helping  O
out  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
which  O
I  O
suspect  O
is  O
the  O
parent  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
hearten  O
to  O
see  O
2  O
young  O
gentlemen  O
probably  O
in  O
their  O
mid  O
20  O
to  O
early  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
age  O
running  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

One  O
is  O
at  O
the  O
front  O
,  O
taking  O
orders  O
and  O
payment  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
is  O
inside  O
the  O
stall  O
cooking  O
the  O
noodles  O
.  O

What  O
stood  O
out  O
for  O
the  O

of  O
Wanton  O

(  O

is  O
the  O
eggy  O

springy  O
noodles  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
good  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
was  O
quite  O
average  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
I  O
found  O
the  O
char  O
siew  O
serving  O
was  O
rather  O
pathetic  O

Wanton  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
2.50/  O
$  O
3.00  O
)  O
fared  O
much  O
better  O
to  O
the  O
dry  O
version  O
with  O
the  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
soup  O
allowing  O
the  O
noodles  O
and  O
wanton  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
wanton  O
with  O
its  O
delectable  O
pork  O
filling  O
stands  O
shoulder  O
with  O
other  O
popular  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
stalls  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
rather  O
average  O
and  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
its  O
own  O
unique  O
character  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
interesting  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
Boon  O
Kee  O
Wanton  O
Noodle  O
has  O
always  O
been  O
able  O
to  O
attract  O
a  O
long  O
queue  O
eager  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
.  O

Are  O
you  O
a  O
fan  O
of  O
their  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
,  O
what  O
makes  O
you  O
like  O
it  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
2  O
years  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
visited  O
Todai  O
,  O
popular  O
for  O
its  O
selection  O
of  O
fresh  O
seafood  O
and  O
Alsakan  O
Snow  O
Crabs  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
July  O
,  O
Todai  O
has  O
launched  O
a  O
Longevity  O

to  O
promote  O
healthy  O
living  O
with  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
healing  O
foods  O

The  O
buffet  O

will  O
feature  O
10  O
of  O
the  O
finest  O

food  O
known  O
to  O

We  O
hardly  O
get  O
to  O
have  O
Sea  O
Eel  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Most  O
we  O
had  O
at  O
restaurants  O
are  O
farm  O
bred  O
eel  O
.  O

The  O
sea  O
eel  O
barbecued  O
on  O
spot  O
at  O
the  O
live  O
station  O
was  O
very  O
meaty  O
and  O
fat  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
usual  O
farm  O
bred  O
eel  O
.  O

The  O
rich  O
in  O
vitamins  O
eel  O
is  O
ideal  O
for  O
the  O
Singapore  O
heat  O
aiding  O
in  O
rejuvenating  O
the  O
body  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
fatness  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
much  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

Abalone  O
Ginseng  O

Abalone  O
has  O
the  O
benefits  O
of  O
building  O
and  O
protecting  O
healthy  O
muscle  O
tissues  O
while  O
ginseng  O
chicken  O
soup  O
has  O
energizing  O
properties  O
.  O

The  O
Abalone  O
Ginseng  O
Chicken  O
Soup  O
combines  O
both  O
health  O
benefits  O

The  O
culinary  O
scene  O
in  O
Singapore  O
has  O
been  O
buzzing  O
with  O
the  O
latest  O
opening  O
of  O
Jamie  O
Oliver  O
's  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
at  O
Vivocity  O
.  O

The  O
much  O
anticipated  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
,  O
first  O
in  O
Asia  O
opened  O
its  O
door  O
on  O
17  O
July  O
2013  O
.  O

As  O
expected  O
,  O
long  O
queues  O
have  O
been  O
formed  O
every  O
day  O
since  O
the  O
opening  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
restaurant  O
takes  O
reservation  O
,  O
only  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
tables  O
are  O
set  O
aside  O
each  O
day  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
wiser  O
to  O
join  O
the  O
queue  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
food  O
as  O
reservation  O
has  O
been  O
fully  O
booked  O
till  O
late  O
August  O
at  O
the  O
time  O
of  O
this  O
publication  O
.  O

Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
Singapore  O
is  O
headed  O
by  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
Gary  O
Clarke  O
who  O
is  O
former  O
Jamie  O

Italian  O
UK  O
Head  O
of  O
Academy  O
for  O
Senior  O
Chefs  O

Baked  O
Mushroom  O
4/5  O

There  O
are  O
quite  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
antipasti  O
selections  O
from  O
the  O
menu  O
which  O
comes  O
in  O
planks  O
or  O
plates  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Baked  O
Mushroom  O
(  O
$  O
12.50  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
crispy  O
paper-thin  O
flat  O
bread  O
is  O
topped  O
with  O
sauteed  O
Swiss  O
brown  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
smoked  O
buffalo  O
mozzarella  O
.  O

A  O
delectable  O
antipasti  O
to  O
start  O
of  O
the  O
meal  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Squid  O
4/5  O

The  O
other  O
antipasti  O
we  O
tried  O
was  O
the  O
Crispy  O
Squid  O
(  O
$  O
11.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
fried  O
squid  O
had  O
a  O
delightful  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
crunchy  O
.  O

The  O
flavour  O
was  O
further  O
lifted  O
with  O
a  O
squeeze  O
of  O
the  O
lemon  O
zest  O
and  O
garlic  O
mayo  O
dip  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
portion  O
was  O
way  O
too  O
small  O
for  O
sharing  O
.  O

Black  O
Angel  O
Spaghetti  O
2.8/5  O

The  O
pasta  O
at  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Kitchen  O
is  O
made  O
freshly  O
on  O
site  O
everyday  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
actually  O
quite  O
interested  O
to  O
know  O
how  O
much  O
pasta  O
they  O
need  O
to  O
make  O
daily  O
since  O
most  O
customers  O
come  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
pasta  O
,  O
its  O
an  O
Italian  O
restaurant  O
after  O
all  O
.  O

Inevitably  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
some  O
pasta  O
dishes  O
to  O
try  O
which  O
comes  O
in  O
either  O
appertiser  O
or  O
main  O
course  O
portion  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Angel  O
Spaghetti  O
(  O
$  O
16.00/  O
$  O
24.50  O
)  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
al  O
dente  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
firm  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
.  O

The  O
squid  O
ink  O
pasta  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
scallops  O
,  O
garlic  O
,  O
chilli  O
,  O
anchovies  O
,  O
wine  O
and  O
capers  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
good  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
dish  O
though  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
whole  O
execution  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
bland  O
side  O
.  O

Jool  O
's  O
Favourite  O
Sicilian  O
Tuna  O
Fusilli  O
4/5  O

Another  O
pasta  O
dish  O
we  O
tried  O
was  O
named  O
after  O
Jamie  O
's  O
wife  O
,  O
Jool  O
's  O
Favourite  O
Sicilian  O
Tuna  O
Fusilli  O
(  O
$  O
14/  O
$  O
21  O
)  O
,  O
Albacore  O
tuna  O
slow  O
cooked  O
with  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
garlic  O
,  O
herbs  O
and  O
cinnamon  O
.  O

The  O
pleasing  O
spicy  O
tanginess  O
and  O
the  O
delightful  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
Fusilli  O
made  O
it  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
better  O
dishes  O
we  O
tried  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
how  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
served  O
the  O
herby  O
breadcrumb  O
on  O
the  O
spoon  O
for  O
their  O
pasta  O
and  O
risotto  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
breadcrumb  O
gave  O
the  O
dish  O
a  O
lift  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Brixham  O
Bay  O
Crab  O
Risotto  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Brixham  O
Bay  O
Crab  O
Risotto  O
(  O
$  O
19.00/  O
$  O
28.50  O
)  O
uses  O
acquerello  O
rice  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

Topped  O
with  O
lemony  O
crab  O
,  O
samphire  O
and  O
chilli  O
,  O
the  O
creamy  O
risotto  O
was  O
bursting  O
with  O
beautiful  O
flavours  O
.  O

While  O
flavours  O
we  O
incredibly  O
good  O
,  O
the  O
crab  O
meat  O
seemed  O
to  O
be  O
lost  O
in  O
the  O
sea  O
of  O
grains  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
more  O
chunky  O
crab  O
meats  O
for  O
the  O
price  O
I  O
am  O
paying  O
.  O

Lamb  O
Chop  O
Lollipops  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Lamb  O
Chop  O
Lollipops  O
(  O
$  O
29.90  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
dish  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
bone-in  O
grilled  O
lamb  O
chops  O
were  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
creamy  O
artichoke  O
and  O
mint  O
sauce  O
,  O
roasted  O
nuts  O
,  O
chilli  O
and  O
fresh  O
mint  O
.  O

The  O
lamb  O
was  O
tender  O
,  O
succulent  O
and  O
cooked  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
pink  O
.  O

Ji  O
Warm  O
Brownie  O
3/5  O

For  O
dessert  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Ji  O
Warm  O
Brownie  O
(  O
$  O
11.50  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
made  O
from  O
mix  O
of  O
chocolate  O
,  O
raspberry  O
and  O
amaretto  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
scoop  O
of  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

The  O
brownie  O
was  O
really  O
moist  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
warm  O
.  O

Creamy  O
Panna  O
Cotta  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Creamy  O
Panna  O
Cotta  O
(  O
$  O
9  O
)  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
dessert  O
at  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
.  O

Everyone  O
who  O
has  O
tried  O
it  O
has  O
recommended  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
wobbly  O
light  O
,  O
silky  O
and  O
smooth  O
panna  O
cotta  O
served  O
with  O
fruit  O
compote  O
was  O
a  O
memorable  O
dessert  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
night  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

Overall  O
,  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
is  O
a  O
casual  O
restaurant  O
with  O
homely  O
Italian  O
food  O

may  O
be  O
a  O

considering  O
its  O
a  O

it  O
is  O
quite  O
reasonable  O

Judging  O
from  O
the  O
daily  O

it  O
seems  O
like  O

do  O
not  O
mind  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

Staffs  O
are  O
very  O
attentive  O

there  O
was  O
a  O

Braised  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Bun  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
Chef  O
Stephane  O
's  O
interpretation  O
of  O
the  O
Kong  O
Bak  O
Pau  O
.  O

Unlike  O
the  O
Chinese  O
's  O
version  O
,  O
the  O
Braised  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Bun  O
(  O
$  O
6/pc  O
)  O
with  O
pickled  O
cucumber  O
,  O
leeks  O
and  O
espelette  O
pepper  O
has  O
a  O
more  O
subtle  O
execution  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
marinated  O
for  O
16  O
hours  O
in  O
pineapple  O
juice  O
sandwiched  O
in  O
an  O
extremely  O
soft  O
and  O
fluffy  O
bun  O
.  O

Next  O

Chef  O
Stephane  O
cooked  O
us  O
a  O
pot  O
of  O
piping  O
hot  O
Vegetable  O
Chicken  O

He  O
even  O
personally  O
served  O
us  O
and  O
added  O
some  O
special  O
``  O
black  O
''  O
ingredients  O
into  O
each  O
bowl  O
.  O

Can  O
you  O
guess  O
what  O
Chef  O
Stephane  O
is  O
shaving  O
into  O
each  O
bowl  O
of  O
the  O
vegetable  O
chicken  O
soup  O
?  O

Vegetable  O
Chicken  O
Soup  O
with  O
Truffle  O
3.5/5  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
generous  O
of  O
Chef  O
Stephane  O
to  O
add  O
shaved  O
truffle  O
into  O
our  O
soup  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
feel  O
his  O
love  O
now  O
.  O

Nothing  O
sophisticated  O
,  O
just  O
direct  O
nature  O
flavours  O
which  O
was  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
.  O

served  O
with  O
arugula  O
,  O
tomato  O
confit  O
,  O
almonds  O
and  O
romesco  O
colis  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
tad  O
of  O
smokiness  O
of  O
the  O
tender  O
octopus  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crunch  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Spinach  O

Being  O
a  O

,  O
my  O
eyes  O
brighten  O
with  O
the  O
Spinach  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
layers  O
of  O
textures  O
that  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
plate  O
of  O
spinach  O
,  O
goat  O

The  O
sweet  O

together  O
with  O
the  O
garlic  O
pork  O
sausage  O
,  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
parsley  O
and  O
white  O
wine  O
was  O
a  O
delish  O
combination  O
that  O
was  O
very  O
addictive  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

A  O
must  O

a  O
3  O
days  O

.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
succulent  O
meat  O
,  O
the  O
suckling  O
pig  O
still  O
has  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
that  O
porky  O
taste  O
that  O
did  O
not  O
escape  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
more  O
sensitive  O
palate  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
.  O

Australian  O

one  O
of  O
my  O
favourites  O

The  O
grilled  O

was  O
extremely  O

were  O
the  O
other  O
favourites  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
instant  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
hit  O
my  O
palate  O
a  O
familiar  O
Asian  O
flavour  O
struck  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
challans  O
duck  O
was  O
rubbed  O
with  O
five  O
spices  O
marinade  O
and  O
lovely  O
grilled  O
.  O

The  O
huge  O
bird  O
which  O
weights  O
at  O
least  O
2.5kg  O
maybe  O
pricey  O
but  O
the  O
perfect  O
doneness  O
and  O
succulent  O
meat  O
was  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
tried  O
.  O

The  O
prime  O
rib  O
eye  O
was  O
so  O
flavoursome  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
already  O
beautiful  O
by  O
itself  O
.  O

Lightly  O
seasoned  O
with  O
salt  O
and  O
pepper  O
,  O
the  O
delish  O

While  O

a  O

the  O

was  O

The  O
zi  O
char  O
place  O
took  O
up  O
2  O
stalls  O
at  O

Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
owned  O
by  O
Mr  O
Eng  O
Boon  O
Har  O
but  O
you  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
his  O
18  O
years  O
old  O
son  O
behind  O
the  O
wok  O
cooking  O
your  O
delicious  O
food  O
.  O

His  O
son  O
has  O
been  O
cooking  O
since  O
13  O
years  O
old  O
under  O
the  O
watchful  O
eyes  O
of  O
his  O
father  O
has  O
learnt  O
the  O
trade  O
well  O
.  O

He  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
youngest  O
hawker  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Looks  O
like  O
there  O
is  O
hope  O
for  O
the  O
next  O
generation  O
in  O
Singapore  O
's  O

By  O
the  O

Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
was  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
golden  O
brown  O
colour  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
prawn  O
paste  O
flavour  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
mild  O
.  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
guess  O
anything  O
that  O
is  O
done  O
with  O
salted  O
egg  O
already  O
is  O
a  O
winner  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
at  O
the  O
Zi  O

.  O

Further  O
enhanced  O
with  O
the  O
curry  O
leaves  O
,  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
top  O
notch  O
for  O
the  O
succulent  O
pork  O
ribs  O
.  O

Sambal  O
Stingray  O
4.2/5  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
better  O
Sambal  O
Stingray  O
I  O
have  O
tried  O
.  O

The  O
chilli  O
was  O
the  O
star  O
that  O
complemented  O
the  O
BBQ  O
Sambal  O
Stingray  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
sambal  O
chilli  O
,  O
a  O
must  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
chinchalok  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
stingray  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
the  O

serves  O
it  O
too  O
.  O

have  O

La  O
La  O
3.5/5  O

When  O
shellfish  O
is  O
not  O
cleaned  O
probably  O
,  O
you  O
end  O
up  O
eating  O
sand  O
with  O
the  O
flesh  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
did  O

encounter  O
with  O
the  O

sweet  O

the  O

condiments  O
with  O
the  O

heavenly  O
.  O

It  O
gave  O
the  O

an  O
additional  O
flavour  O

The  O
current  O
Jin  O

Hot/Cold  O
Dessert  O
is  O
a  O
collaboration  O
between  O
2  O
friends  O
Calvin  O
and  O
Ewan  O
back  O
in  O
2004  O
when  O
the  O
previous  O
owner  O
decided  O
to  O
give  O
up  O
the  O
business  O
.  O

With  O
no  O
experience  O
when  O
they  O
started  O
the  O
business  O
,  O
the  O
insurance  O
agent  O
and  O
DJ  O
nearly  O
thrown  O
in  O
the  O
towel  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
upgrading  O
was  O
the  O
turning  O
point  O
,  O
allowing  O
them  O
to  O
start  O
afresh  O
.  O

Both  O
went  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
tasting  O
the  O
different  O
desserts  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
travelling  O
afar  O
in  O
Asia  O
to  O
learn  O
and  O
bring  O
back  O
the  O
country  O
's  O
signature  O

After  O
many  O
trials  O
and  O
errors  O
to  O
perfect  O
the  O
desserts  O
,  O
Jin  O
Jin  O
started  O
afresh  O

their  O
best  O

their  O
Gangster  O
Ice  O
(  O
Durian/Mango  O
Ice  O
)  O
.  O

Gangster  O
Durian  O
Mango  O
Ice  O
is  O
a  O
playful  O
take  O
on  O
how  O
the  O
Mandarin  O
term  O
for  O
the  O
dessert  O
,  O
Liu  O
Lian  O
Mang  O
Guo  O
,  O
sounds  O
like  O
the  O
word  O
gangster  O
when  O
shortened  O
to  O
just  O
Liu  O
Mang  O
.  O

The  O
name  O
Gangster  O
is  O
now  O
a  O
registered  O
trademark  O
.  O

The  O
dessert  O
of  O
mango  O
ice  O
is  O
laden  O
with  O
a  O
generous  O
scoop  O
of  O
durian  O
puree  O
and  O
condensed  O
milk  O
.  O

another  O
unique  O

at  O

.  O

The  O
green  O

a  O
Must  O

was  O
raving  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
Chendol  O
they  O
have  O
ever  O
tasted  O
.  O

What  O
so  O
special  O
about  O
the  O
chendol  O
at  O
Jin  O
Jin  O
is  O
the  O
gula  O
melaka  O
.  O

The  O

uses  O
premium  O
raw  O
gula  O
melaka  O
from  O
Indonesia  O
and  O
cook  O
it  O
painstaking  O
everyday  O
himself  O
.  O

The  O
special  O
gula  O
melaka  O
has  O
a  O
sticky  O
texture  O
like  O
caramel  O
and  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
saltiness  O
that  O
enhanced  O

another  O

2013  O
Makansutra  O
dinner  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Ming  O
Kee  O
Live  O
Seafood  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
thought  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
going  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
restaurant  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
frequent  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
time  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
that  O
the  O
son  O
of  O
Ming  O
Kee  O
Live  O
Seafood  O
has  O
opened  O
another  O
restaurant  O
with  O
the  O

with  O
Garlic  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
everyone  O
was  O
like  O
going  O
wow  O
!  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
generous  O
and  O
sumptuous  O
serving  O
.  O

The  O
tonnes  O
of  O
garlic  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
springy  O
lobster  O
flesh  O
complemented  O
it  O
,  O
allowing  O
one  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
freshness  O
and  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
lobster  O
to  O
the  O
fullest  O
.  O

Braised  O
Crocodile  O

Stock  O
3/5  O

The  O
dish  O
had  O
everyone  O
guessing  O
what  O
was  O
it  O
because  O
all  O
of  O
uscould  O
not  O
tell  O
whatwas  O
the  O
jelly  O
liked  O
ingredient  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
some  O
sea  O
cucumber  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
crocodile  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
Braised  O
Crocodile  O
Horn  O
Strip  O
in  O
Superior  O
Stock  O
actually  O
tasted  O
like  O
the  O
peppery  O
pig  O
intestine  O
soup  O
.  O

Jumbo  O

Oyster  O
4.5/5  O

.  O

The  O
table  O
probably  O
went  O
triple  O
wow  O
,  O
wow  O
,  O
wow  O
!  O

when  O
the  O
Jumbo  O
Canadian  O
Oyster  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
biggest  O
giant  O
oyster  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
eaten  O
.  O

Drizzled  O
with  O
a  O
delectable  O
black  O
bean  O
sauce  O
,  O
the  O
combination  O
was  O
simple  O
heavenly  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Soon  O
Hock  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Style  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Soon  O
Hock  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Style  O
was  O
interesting  O
cut  O
into  O
chunks  O
.  O

The  O
snow  O
white  O
chunks  O
of  O
fish  O
meat  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
firm  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Duck  O
Breast  O
4/5  O

The  O
Smoked  O
Duck  O
Breast  O
was  O
very  O
beautiful  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
smokey  O
fragrant  O
,  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
still  O
pink  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Guinness  O
Sauce  O
Short  O
Rib  O
4/5  O

The  O
Guinness  O
Sauce  O
Short  O
Rib  O
was  O
evenly  O
coated  O
and  O
caramelised  O
.  O

The  O

rib  O
was  O
succulent  O
and  O
packed  O

Triple  O
Cooked  O
Crab  O
Beehoon  O
3.8/5  O

I  O
was  O
eagerly  O
waiting  O
for  O
Ming  O
Kee  O
's  O
signature  O
Triple  O
Cooked  O
Crab  O
Beehoon  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
whenever  O
I  O
visit  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
version  O
at  O
Ming  O
Kee  O
because  O
the  O
beehoon  O
is  O
very  O
flavourful  O
absorbing  O
and  O
infusing  O
the  O
robust  O
crab  O
flavour  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
Triple  O
Cooked  O
Crab  O
Beehoon  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
salty  O
side  O
that  O
day  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
disappointed  O
.  O

The  O

,  O
there  O

8  O
different  O
dishes  O
to  O
choose  O
from  O
.  O

Each  O
portion  O
is  O
sightly  O
smaller  O
than  O
an  O
entree  O
so  O
that  O
diners  O
can  O
enjoy  O
as  O
many  O
orders  O
of  O

at  O
the  O

.  O

out  O
of  O

.  O

Having  O
tried  O
Gunther'sangel  O

before  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
rather  O
disappointed  O
with  O
the  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
with  O
Truffles  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O
dish  O
was  O
miserably  O
lacking  O
of  O
truffle  O
,  O
hardly  O
can  O
I  O
find  O
a  O
trace  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Baby  O

Thermidor  O
4.2/5  O

The  O

cheese  O
and  O
the  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
browsing  O
the  O

the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Dumplings  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
catch  O
my  O
attention  O
.  O

The  O
flat  O
shaped  O
dumplings  O
did  O
not  O
look  O
appertising  O
but  O
the  O
lovely  O
foie  O
gras  O
flavour  O
simply  O
burst  O
and  O
filled  O
the  O
whole  O
mouth  O
upon  O
biting  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

Pan  O
Seared  O
Scallops  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Pan  O
Seared  O
Scallops  O
with  O
English  O
peas  O
espuma  O
,  O
chorizo  O
and  O
peppers  O
were  O
big  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

The  O
scallop  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
beautiful  O
,  O
the  O
peas  O
espuma  O
was  O
not  O
really  O
necessary  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Wagyu  O
Beef  O

The  O
succulent  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O

seasoned  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
fullest  O
of  O
the  O
flavourful  O
meat  O
.  O

Served  O
with  O
potato  O
rosti  O
,  O
greens  O
and  O
red  O
wine  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
delish  O
dish  O
that  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
happy  O
to  O
clean  O
off  O
.  O

Broiled  O
Chilean  O

among  O
the  O

tried  O
.  O

While  O
I  O

the  O

,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O

was  O

of  O

for  O

When  O

with  O
the  O

the  O
combination  O
reminded  O

The  O

probably  O
the  O
least  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
kind  O
of  O
dry  O
and  O
felt  O
like  O
the  O
dish  O
is  O
screaming  O
for  O
more  O
sauce  O
.  O

For  O
a  O

Opened  O
by  O
the  O
folks  O
from  O
Cookyn  O
,  O
GRUBis  O
their  O
latest  O
venture  O
at  O
the  O
tranquil  O
Bishan  O
Park  O
.  O

The  O
fun  O
bistro  O
concept  O
uses  O
ingredients  O
sourced  O
from  O
an  O
ethnic  O
group  O
of  O
farmers  O
,  O
fishermen  O
and  O
artisanal  O
producers  O
with  O
good  O
responsible  O
practices  O
.  O

No  O
MSG  O
,  O
artificial  O
preservatives  O
,  O
additives  O
or  O
flavourings  O
are  O
used  O
in  O
their  O

Cocotte  O

The  O
Truffled  O
Egg  O
Cocotte  O
(  O
$  O
7  O
)  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
crispy  O
parma  O

and  O
toasted  O
focaccia  O
.  O

Dunking  O
the  O
focaccia  O
into  O
the  O
runny  O
egg  O
enhanced  O
by  O
the  O
truffle  O
flavour  O
was  O
simply  O
heavenly  O
and  O
addictive  O
.  O

Tasmanian  O

Stew  O
2/5  O

The  O
Tasmanian  O
Mussels  O
&  O
Chorizo  O
Stew  O
(  O
$  O
19  O
)  O
was  O
rather  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
stew  O
was  O
watered  O
down  O
and  O
bland  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
have  O
preferred  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
thick  O
velvety  O
stew  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
mussels  O
were  O
fresh  O
and  O
fat  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
chorizo  O
.  O

The  O
pairing  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
odd  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

,  O
the  O
GRUB  O
Cheeseburger  O
(  O
$  O
11  O
)  O
was  O
nicely  O
executed  O
.  O

The  O
size  O
is  O
just  O
nice  O
and  O
easy  O
to  O
handle  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O

was  O
also  O

Belly  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
sitting  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
mashed  O
potato  O
is  O
another  O
worthy  O
dish  O
to  O
try  O
at  O
GRUB  O
.  O

Cooked  O
perfectly  O
until  O
fork  O
tender  O
and  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
,  O
the  O
meat  O
surprisingly  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
with  O
the  O
mango  O
sauce  O
and  O
cherry  O
tomato  O
salsa  O
.  O

Surrounded  O
by  O
the  O
beautiful  O
greenery  O
of  O
Bishan  O
Park  O
,  O
GRUB  O
worthy  O
of  O
a  O
visit  O
with  O
its  O
casual  O
and  O
friendly  O
bistro  O
ambience  O
.  O

GRUB  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
nice  O
place  O
to  O
chill  O
out  O
with  O
its  O
selection  O
of  O

beer  O
from  O

Voted  O
Best  O
Family  O
Restaurant  O
in  O
Parents  O
World  O
for  O
2  O
consecutive  O
years  O
in  O
2011  O
and  O
2012  O
,  O
The  O
King  O
Louis  O
Grill  O
and  O
Bar  O
is  O
Singapore  O
first  O
medieval  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Tucked  O
in  O
a  O
corner  O
at  O
Vivocity  O
on  O
the  O
third  O
level  O
(  O
beside  O
Daiso  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
castle  O
theme  O

kept  O
the  O
young  O

Teriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

To  O
whet  O
up  O
our  O
appetite  O
for  O
the  O
banquet  O
feast  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Teriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
fresh  O
garden  O
salad  O
,  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
breast  O
meat  O
topped  O
with  O
teriyaki  O
sauce  O
and  O
parmesan  O
cheese  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
individual  O
components  O
stood  O
out  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
teriyaki  O
sauce  O
was  O
too  O
much  O
masking  O
off  O
the  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O
greens  O
.  O

Signature  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
homemade  O
Signature  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
mix  O
of  O
button  O
and  O
shiitake  O
mushrooms  O
served  O
with  O
garlic  O
and  O
herbs  O
bread  O
.  O

The  O
creamy  O
mushroom  O
soup  O
was  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
.  O

The  O
serving  O
was  O
pretty  O
huge  O
too  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
found  O
it  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
table  O
disagreed  O
with  O
me  O
.  O

Platter  O
C  O
3/5  O

When  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
diners  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
always  O
good  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
platter  O
for  O
sharing  O
before  O
the  O
mains  O
are  O
served  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Platter  O
C  O
(  O
$  O
21.90  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
chicken  O
drumlets  O
,  O
banana  O
bacon  O
bites  O
,  O
golden  O
calamari  O
,  O
prawn  O
twisters  O
and  O
crispy  O
wedges  O
.  O

Not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
fried  O
food  O
but  O
the  O
prawn  O
twister  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
drumlets  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
was  O
dried  O
and  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
banana  O
bacon  O
bites  O
was  O
interesting  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
wow  O
factor  O
.  O

Queen  O
Victoria  O
(  O
Meat  O
&  O
Seafood  O
)  O
4/5  O

The  O
menu  O
at  O
The  O
King  O
Lousi  O
Grill  O
and  O
Bar  O
is  O
conceptualized  O
for  O
one  O
to  O
feast  O
like  O
a  O
king  O
and  O
hence  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
items  O
like  O
Knight  O
Banquet  O
,  O
Queen  O
Banquet  O
and  O
King  O
Banquet  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
banquet  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
opt  O
for  O
meat  O
,  O
seafood  O
or  O
either  O
both  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Queen  O
Banquet  O
,  O
Queen  O
Victoria  O
(  O
Meat  O
&  O
Seafood  O
)  O
that  O
serves  O
about  O
4-5  O
people  O
(  O
$  O
166.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
queen  O

comes  O
with  O
roasted  O

with  O
black  O

,  O
premium  O

Queen  O
Victoria  O
(  O

&  O
Seafood  O
)  O
4/5  O

Among  O
all  O
the  O
premium  O
BBQ  O
baby  O
back  O
ribs  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
baby  O
back  O
ribs  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
easily  O
.  O

The  O
roasted  O
beef  O
was  O
also  O
nicely  O
executed  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
scallop  O
,  O
the  O
snapper  O
and  O
prawn  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
snapper  O
was  O
dried  O
and  O
the  O
prawn  O
was  O
mushy  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
still  O
find  O
The  O
King  O
Louis  O
Grill  O
and  O
Bar  O
is  O
a  O
great  O
place  O
for  O
family  O
and  O
large  O
group  O
dining  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
an  O
unblock  O
view  O
looking  O
across  O
Sentosa  O
island  O
,  O
diners  O
can  O

Back  O
in  O
March  O
2013  O
,  O
I  O
celebrated  O
my  O
birthday  O
by  O
booking  O
a  O
staycation  O
over  O
the  O
weekendat  O
the  O
newly  O
opened  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
.  O

The  O
hotel  O
was  O
designed  O
by  O
local  O
award  O
winning  O
architectural  O
firm  O
Woha  O
,  O
creating  O
a  O
hotel  O
in  O
a  O
garden  O
design  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
recommend  O
the  O
hotel  O
to  O
tourist  O
because  O
of  O
its  O
excellent  O
location  O
that  O
is  O
accessible  O
and  O
a  O
stone  O
throw  O
away  O
to  O
many  O
interesting  O
places  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Chinatown  O
MRT  O
station  O
and  O
Clark  O
Quay  O
MRT  O
station  O
is  O
only  O
5  O
minutes  O
walk  O
away  O
.  O

Right  O
beside  O
the  O
hotel  O
is  O
Hong  O
Lim  O
Food  O
Centre  O
where  O
one  O
can  O
savour  O
the  O
local  O
delicacies  O
.  O

Chinatown  O
,  O
Clark  O
Quay  O
and  O
Boat  O
Quay  O
are  O
also  O
within  O
walking  O
vicinity  O
from  O
the  O
hotel  O
.  O

Lime  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
restaurant  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
with  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
glass  O
windows  O
and  O
three  O
open  O
kitchens  O
.  O

The  O
spacious  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
friendly  O
and  O
welcoming  O
ambience  O
offering  O
a  O
diverse  O
selection  O
of  O
international  O
cuisines  O
and  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
.  O

My  O
room  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
tenth  O
floor  O
.  O

To  O
get  O
to  O
my  O
room  O
which  O
is  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
hotel  O
,  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
walk  O
through  O
this  O
outdoor  O
corridor  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
closer  O
look  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
the  O
right  O
of  O
the  O
corridor  O
are  O
exactly  O
hotel  O
rooms  O
with  O
greenery  O
wall  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
corridor  O
indoor  O
leading  O
to  O
my  O
hotel  O
room  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
Superior  O
King  O
room  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
booked  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
window  O
design  O
allowing  O
the  O
natural  O
light  O
to  O
light  O
up  O
the  O
room  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
very  O
welcoming  O
ambience  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
hotel  O
creatively  O
uses  O
partition  O
for  O
the  O
room  O
.  O

Noticed  O
the  O
mirror  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
room  O
?  O

It  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
sliding  O
partition  O
.  O

Behind  O
the  O
sliding  O
partition  O
is  O
the  O
toilet  O
and  O
shower  O
room  O
.  O

The  O
toiletries  O
are  O
pretty  O
standard  O
.  O

Beside  O
the  O
comfort  O
king  O
size  O
bed  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
with  O
the  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
windows  O
alot  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
interior  O
deisgner  O
who  O
creatively  O
made  O
used  O
of  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
sitting  O
area  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
table  O
area  O
at  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
beside  O
where  O
the  O
beverages  O
are  O
stored  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
thoughtful  O
design  O
making  O
use  O
of  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
again  O
.  O

The  O
work  O
desk  O
is  O
quite  O
spacious  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
very  O
comfort  O
seat  O
.  O

My  O
booking  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
complimentary  O
access  O
to  O
the  O
rooftop  O
Orchid  O
Club  O
Lounge  O
.  O

The  O
lounge  O
offers  O
a  O
spectacular  O
360  O
degree  O
views  O
of  O
the  O
Singapore  O
city  O
skyline  O
.  O

Spent  O
sometime  O
at  O
the  O
Orchid  O
Club  O
Lounge  O
for  O
some  O
high  O
tea  O
before  O
I  O
proceed  O
on  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
hotels  O
.  O

The  O
infinity  O
pool  O
on  O
the  O
5th  O
floor  O
of  O
the  O
hotel  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
but  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
view  O
looking  O
across  O
Hong  O
Lim  O
Park  O
.  O

What  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
is  O
the  O
bird  O
cage  O
like  O
structure  O
which  O
is  O
actually  O
oversized  O
cabanas  O
designed  O
to  O
resemble  O
flowers  O
about  O
to  O
bloom  O
amongst  O
the  O
foliage  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
enjoyed  O
my  O
staycation  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
and  O
I  O
highly  O
recommend  O
this  O
place  O
for  O
tourists  O
if  O
you  O
are  O
not  O
on  O
a  O
budget  O

Ayam  O
Penyet  O
President  O
is  O
the  O
new  O
resident  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
NEX  O
servicing  O
authentic  O
Indonesian  O
cuisine  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
an  O
experience  O
and  O
meal  O
that  O
is  O
fit  O
for  O
a  O
president  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
brought  O
to  O
reality  O
very  O
soon  O
when  O
I  O
needed  O
to  O
walk  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
cashier  O
to  O
place  O
my  O
order  O
and  O
made  O
payment  O
before  O
I  O
got  O
my  O
food  O
served  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
not  O
how  O
you  O
treat  O
a  O
president  O
or  O
rather  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
treated  O
like  O
a  O
president  O
.  O

Tahu  O
Telor  O
2/5  O

The  O
Tahu  O
Telor  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
big  O
disappointment  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
expecting  O
a  O
tall  O
standing  O
tower  O
of  O
the  O
tahu  O
telor  O
but  O
instead  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
with  O
pieces  O
of  O
fried  O
beancurd  O
wrapped  O
in  O
by  O
a  O
omelette  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
felt  O
I  O
was  O
being  O
cheated  O
.  O

Ayam  O
Penyet  O
3/5  O

The  O
Ayam  O
Penyet  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
Malay  O
word  O
which  O
literally  O
means  O
smashed  O
fried  O
chicke  O
does  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
steamed  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
0.80  O
)  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
order  O
separately  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
,  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
not  O
flatted  O
or  O
smashed  O
enough  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
wished  O
I  O
could  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
crispy  O
bits  O
.  O

Ayam  O
Bakar  O
3.5/5  O

I  O
also  O
tried  O
the  O
Ayam  O
Bakar  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
grilled  O
tofu  O
,  O
bean  O
cake  O
and  O
cut  O
chilli  O
in  O
black  O
sauce  O
.  O

Actually  O
the  O
waitress  O
left  O
out  O
the  O
cut  O
chilii  O
in  O
black  O
sauce  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
asked  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
with  O
the  O
sweet  O
sauce  O
drenched  O
over  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
flavourful  O
.  O

It  O
complemented  O
the  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
chicken  O
.  O

Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Juice  O
a  O
laPresident3.5/5  O
Iced  O
Chendol  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
meal  O
ended  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
with  O
the  O
Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Juice  O
a  O
la  O
President  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
and  O
Ice  O
Chendol  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
mixed  O
fruit  O
juice  O
a  O
la  O
president  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
Chinese  O
version  O
of  O
Ice  O
Kachang  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
here  O
is  O
just  O
average  O
and  O
definitely  O
you  O
wo  O
n't  O
be  O
getting  O
the  O
president  O
treatment  O
.  O

Unless  O
I  O
need  O
a  O
quick  O
meal  O
or  O
avoid  O
the  O
crowd  O
,  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O
not  O
visit  O
the  O
eatery  O
.  O

Yesterday  O
I  O
met  O
up  O
with  O
my  O
friends  O
at  O
Clark  O
Quay  O
for  O
steamboat  O
at  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
and  O
service  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
great  O
place  O
for  O
group  O
gathering  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
took  O
out  O
my  O
Iphone  O
and  O
Pick  O
this  O
place  O
to  O
share  O
with  O
my  O
friends  O
on  O
Pickat  O
SG  O
.  O

What  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
Pick  O
?  O

In  O
short  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
like  O
Facebook  O
status  O
post  O
or  O
a  O
Twitter  O
tweet  O
where  O
you  O
share  O
a  O
Place+  O
Theme  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
also  O
include  O
photos  O
and  O
a  O
brief  O
review  O
up  O
to  O
500  O
words  O
.  O

To  O
create  O
a  O
pick  O
,  O
you  O
simply  O
click  O
on  O
the  O
pick  O
icon  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
right  O
corner  O
of  O
the  O

How  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
Pick  O
?  O

Pick  O
is  O
a  O
Place+  O
Theme  O
,  O
so  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
input  O
the  O
location  O
followed  O
by  O
the  O
theme  O
.  O

Simply  O
key  O
in  O
the  O
location  O
of  O
the  O
place  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
Pick  O
and  O
click  O
search  O
.  O

Then  O
select  O
the  O
outlet  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
make  O
a  O
pick  O
.  O

What  O
is  O
a  O
Theme  O
?  O

A  O
theme  O
is  O
like  O
a  O
label  O
or  O
a  O
post  O
header  O
where  O
it  O
expresses  O
the  O
experience/view/opinion  O
of  O
a  O
place  O
you  O
have  O
visited  O
.  O

The  O
cool  O
part  O
is  O
you  O
can  O
create  O
your  O
own  O
Unique  O
Theme  O
!  O

For  O
example  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
is  O
a  O
great  O
place  O
for  O
gathering  O
,  O
hence  O
I  O
created  O
the  O
theme  O
Great  O
Place  O
for  O
Gathering  O
.  O

To  O
complete  O
your  O
Pick  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
upload  O
your  O

4  O
pictures  O
)  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
your  O
review  O
of  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

The  O
great  O
thing  O
is  O
after  O
you  O
have  O
completed  O
your  O
Pick  O
,  O
you  O
can  O

After  O
queuing  O
for  O
about  O
15-20  O
minutes  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
order  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O

Dry  O
(  O

.  O

I  O
opted  O
for  O

instead  O
of  O

After  O
cooking  O
the  O
noodle  O
,  O
Mr  O

will  O
topped  O
the  O

of  O

with  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
nostalgic  O
flavour  O
of  O
1960s  O
?  O

While  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
flavourful  O
but  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
dry  O
.  O

The  O
kway  O
teow  O
texture  O
was  O
a  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
thick  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
smooth  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
like  O
.  O

Overall  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
a  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
duck  O
noodle  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
rustic  O
taste  O
that  O
probably  O
will  O
bring  O
back  O
childhood  O
memories  O
for  O

it  O
hard  O
to  O
associate  O
the  O
name  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
dish  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O
skip  O
and  O
spend  O
my  O
dollars  O
on  O
other  O
delish  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
tasting  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
cup  O
covered  O
with  O
Swiss  O
cheese  O
,  O
parmesan  O
and  O
gruyere  O
.  O

The  O
subtlecup  O
of  O
soup  O
was  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
different  O
flavours  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
hope  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
having  O
the  O
exact  O
portion  O
.  O

I  O
will  O
be  O
glad  O
to  O
finish  O
the  O
whole  O
bowl  O
.  O

Shio-Koji  O
Octopoke  O
4.2/5  O

My  O
first  O
introduction  O
to  O
Shio-koji  O
(  O
salted  O
rice  O
malt  O
)  O
is  O
at  O
Japanese  O
Dining  O
SUNat  O
Chijmes  O
hence  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
foreign  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
remembered  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
a  O
platter  O
of  O
shiokoji  O
marinated  O
ingredients  O
and  O
how  O
it  O
enhanced  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
Shio-Koji  O
Octopoke  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
tossed  O
with  O
shiokoji  O
,  O
wasabi  O
,  O
extra  O
virgin  O
oil  O
,  O
avocado  O
and  O
ginger  O
flower  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

The  O
Japanese  O
octopus  O
also  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
and  O
chewy  O
texture  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Umami  O
Prawn  O
Capellini  O
4.2/5  O

A  O
definitely  O
worthy  O
dish  O
to  O
try  O
at  O
Jewel  O
Cafe+  O
Bar  O
is  O
the  O
Umami  O
Prawn  O
Capellini  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
capellini  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
,  O
homemade  O
crustacean  O
oil  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
bonito  O
flakes  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
they  O
used  O
a  O
cooking  O
technique  O
that  O
they  O
learnt  O
from  O
fried  O
hokkien  O
mee  O
to  O
infuse  O
all  O
the  O
wonderful  O
flavours  O
together  O
.  O

OMG  O
Burger  O
4/5  O

All  O
burgers  O
at  O
the  O
cafe  O
are  O
made  O
with  O
USDA  O
beef  O
patties  O
.  O

The  O
whimsical  O
named  O
OMG  O
Burger  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
150  O
gram  O
beef  O
patty  O
,  O
2  O
slices  O
of  O
crispy  O
bacon  O
,  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
,  O
cheddar  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
onion  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
sunny  O
side  O
up  O
sandwiched  O
between  O
2  O
soft  O
sesame  O
brioche  O
buns  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
fries  O
and  O
salad  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
gives  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
the  O
extra  O
texture  O
and  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
bursting  O
juiciness  O
of  O
a  O
burger  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
burger  O
but  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
think  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
.  O

Black  O
Cod  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Black  O
Cod  O
(  O
$  O
32  O
)  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
parsnip  O
mash  O
,  O
sauteed  O
vegetable  O
and  O
cardinal  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
Chilean  O
black  O
cod  O
tasted  O
beautiful  O
and  O
buttery  O
.  O

Brioche  O
French  O
Toast  O
2.8/5  O

The  O
Brioche  O
French  O
Toast  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
lemon  O
zest  O
mascarpone  O
and  O
strawberry  O
,  O
blueberry  O
and  O
caramelised  O
banana  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
3/5  O

The  O
homemade  O
Tiramisu  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
is  O
flavoured  O
with  O
rich  O
Indonesian  O
coffee  O
and  O
rum  O
.  O

Pan  O
Seared  O
Watermelon  O
Steaks  O
2.8/5  O

The  O
Pan  O
Seared  O
Watermelon  O
Steaks  O
(  O
$  O
9  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
homemade  O
pineapple  O
sorbet  O
,  O
basil  O
leaves  O
,  O
balsamic  O
glaze  O
and  O
sea  O
salt  O
.  O

Desserts  O
for  O
me  O
was  O
rather  O
average  O
for  O
a  O
cafe  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
excitement  O
compared  O
to  O
their  O
whimsical  O
appertisers  O
and  O
mains  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
felt  O
it  O
is  O
overpriced  O
for  O
what  O
is  O
being  O
put  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
do  O
understand  O
that  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
having  O
a  O
bigger  O
pastry  O
kitchen  O
and  O
coming  O
up  O
with  O
more  O
delectable  O
desserts  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
in  O
going  O
back  O
not  O
only  O
for  O
the  O
mains  O
and  O
coffee  O
but  O
their  O
new  O
desserts  O
too  O
.  O

the  O

The  O

me  O

for  O

I  O

I  O

have  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
Curry  O
Mee  O
(  O
$  O
4/5/6  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
an  O
artery  O
clogging  O
thick  O
and  O
robust  O
curry  O
gravy  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
tasted  O
nothing  O
near  O
the  O
Indian  O
or  O
Malay  O
curry  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
its  O
own  O
characteristic  O
representing  O
the  O
Chinese  O
style  O
curry  O
from  O
an  O
over  O
40  O
years  O
old  O
recipe  O
passed  O
down  O

You  O
may  O
not  O
believe  O
it  O
but  O
the  O
curry  O
gravy  O
brings  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
different  O
components  O
together  O
and  O
it  O
actually  O
works  O
in  O
a  O
wonderfully  O
and  O
delectable  O
way  O
.  O

The  O
greasy  O
curry  O
was  O
so  O
addictive  O
that  O
I  O
just  O
ca  O
n't  O
stop  O
until  O
I  O
emptied  O
the  O
whole  O
bowl  O
.  O

I  O
guess  O
I  O
just  O
have  O
to  O
leave  O

4.5/5  O

For  O
something  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
burger  O
menu  O
,  O
the  O
CW  O
Cod  O
Fish  O
Burger  O
(  O
$  O
26  O
)  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
.  O

The  O
burger  O
came  O
with  O
perfectly  O
grilled  O
succulent  O
and  O
buttery  O
Atlantic  O
Cod  O
in  O
pommery  O
marinate  O
sandwiched  O
with  O
a  O
parmesan  O
bun  O
and  O
lemony  O
herbed  O
mayo  O
served  O
with  O
vine  O
cherry  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
romaine  O
lettuce  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
quintessential  O
burger  O
blown  O
me  O
away  O
with  O
the  O
execution  O
and  O
flavours  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
dish  O
that  O
will  O
bring  O
me  O
back  O
again  O
.  O

is  O
a  O

but  O
it  O
is  O
worth  O
paying  O
for  O
the  O

the  O
whole  O

but  O
offering  O
only  O
one  O
and  O

Together  O
with  O
Daniel  O
,  O
Nicole  O
and  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
we  O
went  O
down  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Thai  O
food  O
on  O
a  O
Saturday  O
evening  O
.  O

Tom  O
Yum  O
Seafood  O
Soup  O
Clear  O
4/5  O

The  O
restaurant  O
insists  O
of  O
using  O
charcoal  O
for  O
their  O
soup  O
and  O
steamed  O
dishes  O
to  O
keep  O
the  O
dish  O
simmering  O
hot  O
consistently  O
without  O
affecting  O
the  O
quality  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Seafood  O
Soup  O
Clear  O
(  O
$  O
6/  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
balance  O
of  O
the  O
characteristic  O
hot  O
and  O
sour  O
flavours  O
with  O
a  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O
fresh  O
seafood  O
.  O

Nam  O
Tok  O
Moo  O
(  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Salad  O
)  O
3.5/5  O

For  O
Thai  O
cuisine  O
,  O
I  O
usually  O
order  O
the  O
papaya  O
or  O
green  O
mango  O
salad  O
for  O
appertiser  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
change  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Nam  O
Tok  O
Moo  O
or  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
grilled  O
pork  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
dry  O
but  O
the  O
medley  O
of  O
flavours  O
definitely  O
whetted  O
up  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fried  O
Kang  O

The  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Kang  O
Kong  O
with  O
Chilli  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
well  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

A  O
simple  O
and  O
comfort  O
dish  O
that  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
pleasant  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Green  O
Curry  O
with  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

I  O
always  O
enjoy  O
Green  O
Curry  O
with  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
because  O
it  O
goes  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
.  O

Green  O
curry  O
is  O
actually  O
not  O
spicy  O
but  O
sweet  O
instead  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
creamy  O
mild  O
green  O
curry  O
with  O
baby  O
Thai  O
eggplant  O
,  O
long  O
beans  O
and  O
chicken  O
pieces  O
was  O
so  O
delectable  O
that  O
I  O
drenched  O
my  O
plate  O
of  O
rice  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fried  O
Phad  O
Thai  O
with  O
Seafood  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
seldom  O
order  O
Pad  O
Thai  O
in  O
Singapore  O
because  O
they  O
were  O
usually  O
disappointing  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
my  O
table  O
decided  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Phad  O
Thai  O
with  O
Seafood  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
you  O
can  O
get  O
in  O
Thailand  O
.  O

The  O
Phad  O
Thai  O
from  O
Spicy  O
Thai  O
-  O
Thai  O
Cafe  O
is  O
definitely  O
one  O
of  O
best  O
in  O
town  O
.  O

BBQ  O
Chicken  O
Wing  O
3/5  O

The  O
BBQ  O
Chicken  O
Wing  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
for  O
4pc  O
,  O
$  O
9  O
for  O
6pc  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
sweet  O
with  O
the  O
marination  O
.  O

It  O
will  O
be  O
perfect  O
if  O
they  O
can  O
do  O
some  O
adjustment  O
with  O
the  O
marinate  O
.  O

Hommok  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Otak  O
4/5  O

Unlike  O
our  O
local  O

,  O
the  O
Hommok  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Otak  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
hasa  O
more  O
mushy  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
isnot  O
spicy  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
mousseline  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
fruity  O
coconut  O
flavour  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
surprise  O
bites  O
of  O
the  O
coconut  O
flesh  O
.  O

Red  O
Ruby  O

Mango  O
Sticky  O
Rice  O
4.5/5  O

We  O
have  O
the  O
staple  O
Thai  O
desserts  O
,  O
Red  O
Ruby  O
and  O
Mango  O
Sticky  O
Rice  O
to  O
end  O
our  O
dinner  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
red  O
ruby  O
was  O
good  O
especially  O
after  O
a  O
spicy  O
feast  O
to  O
cool  O
off  O
that  O
heat  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
mango  O
sticky  O
rice  O
that  O
stood  O
out  O
.  O

It  O
instantly  O
brought  O
back  O
memories  O
of  O
thismango  O
sticky  O
rice  O
stall  O
which  O
I  O
frequent  O
whenever  O
I  O
go  O
to  O
Thailand  O
.  O

Like  O
the  O
stall  O
,  O
roasted  O
fragrant  O
sesame  O
seeds  O
were  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
which  O
simplyraised  O
the  O
enjoyment  O
a  O
bar  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
rest  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
Spicy  O
Thai  O
-  O
Thai  O
Caf  O
is  O
worth  O
a  O
visit  O
if  O
you  O
are  O
looking  O
forauthentic  O
Thai  O
food  O
that  O
does  O
not  O
burnt  O
a  O

With  O
its  O
spacious  O

,  O
it  O
is  O

family  O
and  O

dinner  O
.  O

served  O
here  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
mere  O
$  O
35  O

you  O
will  O
get  O
a  O
big  O
plate  O
of  O

I  O
am  O
pretty  O
satisfiedwith  O

Kicked  O

Among  O

I  O
tried  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O

was  O
better  O
with  O
seafood  O
than  O
meat  O

My  O
favourite  O
was  O

had  O
the  O
spaghetti  O
with  O
mushroom  O
cream  O

.  O

The  O
pasta  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
al  O

the  O
sauce  O
was  O
bland  O
.  O

(  O
$  O

for  O

/  O
$  O
42  O
for  O

)  O
is  O
prepared  O
accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
well  O
guarded  O
recipe  O
from  O
Soon  O
Heng  O
Restaurant  O
dating  O
from  O
1970s  O
,  O
touted  O
as  O
the  O
creator  O
of  O
the  O
Singaporean  O
Chinese  O
style  O
fish  O
head  O
curry  O
.  O

The  O
red  O
snapper  O
fish  O
head  O
is  O
first  O
steamed  O
and  O
then  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
mildly  O
spiced  O
assam  O

tamarind  O
based  O
curry  O
sauce  O
together  O
with  O
tomatoes  O
lady  O

,  O
sliced  O
onions  O
and  O
fresh  O
chillies  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
is  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
,  O
firm  O
and  O
moist  O
with  O
a  O
delectable  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
flesh  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
spicy  O
level  O
can  O
raise  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
notches  O
more  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
find  O
it  O
spicy  O
at  O
all  O

Sad  O
to  O
say  O
the  O
sambal  O
did  O
not  O
mange  O
to  O
excite  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
pungent  O
aroma  O
and  O
spiciness  O
that  O
will  O
give  O
me  O
an  O
avalanche  O

This  O

Whenever  O

The  O

During  O
our  O
visit  O
,  O
we  O
managed  O
to  O
try  O
all  O
the  O
seven  O
soup  O
bases  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
all  O
disappointing  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
either  O
too  O
salty  O
or  O
bland  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
really  O
a  O
pity  O
that  O
the  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
pricing  O
with  O
fresh  O
and  O
quality  O
ingredients  O
were  O
lacked  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
lackluster  O
soup  O
bases  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
bi  O
monthly  O
yuzu  O
salt  O
beauty  O
hotpot  O
was  O
lacking  O
in  O
consistency  O
,  O
tasted  O
salty  O
for  O
one  O
table  O
while  O
another  O
was  O
fine  O
.  O

Unless  O
the  O
restaurant  O
improves  O
with  O
the  O
offering  O
of  O
their  O
soup  O
,  O
safer  O
to  O
go  O
for  O

.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O

but  O
the  O
port  O
village  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
crabs  O
that  O
day  O
so  O
they  O
substituted  O
it  O
with  O

and  O

meat  O
creating  O
a  O
texture  O
and  O
taste  O
similar  O
to  O
crab  O
meat  O
.  O

This  O
delicacy  O
was  O
quite  O

the  O

For  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
May  O
2013  O
,  O
Makansutra  O
dinner  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Quan  O
Xin  O
Yuan  O
(  O
)  O
a  O
traditional  O
Hokkien  O
restaurant  O
that  O
has  O
inherited  O
the  O
family  O
recipes  O
from  O
generation  O
to  O
generation  O
since  O
1930  O
.  O

Our  O
dinner  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
the  O
new  O
outlet  O
at  O
Kitchener  O
Road  O
which  O
is  O
walking  O
distance  O
from  O
their  O
Jalan  O

.  O

Cold  O
Dish  O
Platter  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
dinner  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Cold  O
Dish  O
Platter  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Wu  O
Xiang  O
Fen  O
Ti  O
(  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
the  O
the  O
skin  O
of  O
pig  O
trotter  O
and  O
stuffed  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
labour  O
intensive  O
dish  O
that  O
takes  O
more  O
than  O
10  O
hours  O
to  O
prepare  O
.  O

After  O
skinning  O
the  O
pig  O
trotter  O
and  O
stuffing  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
steamed  O
for  O
2  O
hours  O
and  O
then  O
fridge  O
for  O
another  O
8  O
hours  O
,  O
giving  O
the  O
skin  O
a  O
nice  O
jelly  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
.  O

Roast  O
Sucking  O
Pig  O
4/5  O

The  O
Roast  O
Sucking  O
Pig  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
with  O
crackling  O
skin  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
we  O
even  O
dissected  O
the  O
pig  O
head  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
beautifully  O
roasted  O
crackling  O
skin  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Pomfret  O
3/5  O

I  O
thought  O
Steamed  O
Promfret  O
was  O
a  O
Teochew  O
dish  O
and  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
puzzled  O
when  O
this  O
dish  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
promfret  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
to  O
be  O
shared  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
of  O
11  O
hungry  O
people  O
.  O

Braised  O
Broccoli  O
with  O
Prawns  O
3/5  O

The  O
Braised  O
Broccoli  O
with  O
Prawns  O
was  O
pretty  O
pedestrian  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
big  O
succulent  O
prawns  O
.  O

Chestnut  O
Duck  O
4/5  O

The  O
restaurant  O
prefers  O
to  O
use  O
duck  O
that  O
weights  O
between  O
1.8kg  O
to  O
2kg  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
size  O
with  O
tender  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
Chestnut  O
Duck  O
was  O
indeed  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
apart  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

Hokkien  O
Style  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
Cakes  O
4.2/5  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
have  O
rice  O
cakes  O
prepared  O
in  O
this  O
way  O
.  O

The  O
Hokkien  O
Style  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
Cakes  O
is  O
stir  O
fried  O
with  O
sambal  O
chilli  O
.  O

The  O
end  O
result  O
is  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
bouncy  O
and  O
chewy  O
rice  O
cakes  O
coated  O
with  O
fragrant  O
sambal  O
chilli  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
something  O
I  O
will  O
order  O
again  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

The  O

We  O
had  O

quite  O

a  O

was  O
disappointing  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
was  O
too  O
mild  O
and  O
the  O
top  O

tasted  O
bland  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
get  O
the  O

Crab  O

The  O

Soup  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
per  O
crab  O
,  O
$  O
110  O
for  O
3  O
crabs  O
)  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
tried  O
.  O

The  O
beehoon  O
was  O
also  O
smooth  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
slippery  O
that  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
holding  O
them  O
on  O
our  O
chopsticks  O
.  O

The  O
beehoon  O
was  O
also  O
cut  O
into  O
shorter  O
length  O
similar  O
to  O
Katong  O

.  O

used  O
at  O
Momma  O

Crab  O
Shack  O
weights  O
about  O
650gram  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
sweet  O
but  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
for  O
sharing  O
if  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
big  O
group  O
,  O
probably  O
just  O
nice  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O
.  O

Fresh  O
Steamed  O
Crab  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
best  O
way  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
freshness  O
and  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
crab  O
is  O
to  O
have  O
it  O
steamed  O
.  O

for  O

)  O
was  O
steamed  O
withfragrant  O
Chinese  O
wine  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O
aroma  O
.  O

The  O
delicacy  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
lovely  O
orange  O

.  O

Black  O

The  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Crab  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
per  O
crab  O
,  O
$  O
110  O
for  O
3  O
crabs  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
norm  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
is  O
wetter  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
usually  O
dry  O
version  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
like  O
those  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
used  O
on  O
steaks  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
really  O
an  O
interesting  O
version  O
but  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
for  O
those  O
that  O
ca  O
n't  O
take  O
spice  O
.  O

Chilli  O
Crab  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Chill  O
Crab  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
per  O
crab  O
,  O
$  O
110  O
for  O
3  O
crabs  O
)  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
more  O
gravy  O
version  O
.  O

The  O
version  O
at  O
Momma  O
Kong  O
's  O
Crab  O
Shack  O
is  O
drier  O
and  O
has  O
a  O
garlic  O
taste  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

If  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
sweet  O
and  O
savoury  O
tomato  O
and  O
chilli  O
based  O
sauce  O
.  O

Fried  O
Mantou  O
4.2/5  O

If  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
chance  O
to  O
visit  O
Momma  O
Kong  O
's  O
Crab  O
Shack  O
,  O
a  O
must  O
try  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Mantou  O
(  O
$  O
1.50  O
each  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
Fried  O
Mantou  O
is  O
really  O
special  O
and  O
soft  O
.  O

You  O
probably  O
ca  O
n't  O
find  O
it  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

The  O
best  O
way  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
fried  O
mantou  O
is  O
to  O
dip  O
it  O
into  O
the  O
chilli  O
crab  O
gravy  O
soaking  O
up  O
the  O
delicious  O
sauce  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
understand  O
that  O
Momma  O
Kong  O
's  O
Crab  O
Shack  O
has  O
created  O
a  O
method  O
of  O
freezing  O
the  O
crabs  O
where  O
one  O
can  O
takeaway  O
and  O
just  O
oven  O
heat  O
for  O
consumption  O
.  O

It  O

This  O
year  O
for  O
my  O
mother  O
's  O
birthday  O
I  O
was  O
tasked  O
to  O
buy  O
the  O
birthday  O
cake  O
hence  O
I  O
tweeted  O
on  O

for  O
recommendation  O

Flor  O

.  O

I  O
made  O
my  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
Flor  O
Patisserie  O
and  O
was  O
lucky  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
whole  O
cake  O
as  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
make  O
any  O
pre-order  O
.  O

Flor  O
Patisserie  O
is  O
opened  O
by  O
Chef  O
Yamashita  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
Japanese  O
styled  O
patisserie  O
serving  O
authentic  O
Japanese  O
inspired  O
French  O
pastry  O
.  O

Chef  O
Yamashita  O
brings  O
with  O
him  O
over  O
20  O
years  O
of  O
baking  O
techniques  O
to  O
Singapore  O
and  O
spent  O
a  O
year  O
and  O
a  O
half  O
tailoring  O
his  O
signature  O
cakes  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
climate  O
and  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

I  O
got  O
the  O
Berry  O
Berries  O
(  O
17x12  O
for  O
$  O
38.85  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
soft  O
sponge  O
that  O
is  O
made  O
traditionally  O
without  O
baking  O
powder  O
nor  O
any  O
chemical  O
raising  O
agent  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
filled  O
with  O
fresh  O
strawberries  O
and  O
luscious  O
cream  O
topped  O
with  O
summer  O
berries  O
and  O
fresh  O
fruits  O
.  O

I  O
dislike  O
cakes  O
that  O
are  O
dry  O
,  O
sweet  O
and  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
too  O
much  O
cream  O
.  O

The  O
Berry  O
Berries  O
cake  O
was  O
totally  O
the  O
opposite  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
well  O
harmonized  O
.  O

The  O
cake  O
was  O
very  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

The  O
price  O
is  O
also  O
very  O
reasonable  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
pastries  O
at  O
Flor  O
Patisserie  O
is  O
made  O
entirely  O
of  O
natural  O
and  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
,  O
they  O
do  O
not  O
keep  O
well  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
is  O
best  O
to  O
be  O
consumed  O
on  O
the  O
day  O
itself  O
.  O

Flor  O
Patisserie  O
firmly  O
believes  O
in  O
using  O
on  O
the  O
best  O

to  O
create  O

The  O

wanted  O

of  O

with  O
silver  O
onions  O
,  O
gherkins  O
,  O
scotch  O
eggs  O
and  O
homemade  O
bread  O
.  O

Scotch  O
Eggs  O
are  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
eggs  O
can  O
be  O
wrapped  O
in  O
sausage  O
meat  O
,  O
coated  O
in  O
breadcrumbs  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O
.  O

Love  O
that  O
the  O
yolkwas  O
still  O
runny  O

it  O
came  O
with  O
different  O
textures  O

Smoked  O
Tomato  O
Soup  O
4.5/5  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
tomato  O
soup  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

The  O
Smoked  O
Tomato  O
Soup  O
(  O

Strawberry  O
Spinach  O
Salad  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Strawberry  O
Spinach  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
sounds  O
a  O
bit  O
bizarre  O
with  O
the  O
medley  O
of  O
crumbled  O
blue  O
cheese  O
,  O
pistachios  O
,  O
bacon  O
and  O
avocado  O
drizzled  O
with  O
raspberry  O
vinaigrette  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
and  O
well  O
balanced  O
.  O

Many  O
people  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
the  O
acquire  O
taste  O
of  O
blue  O
cheese  O
but  O
the  O
one  O
used  O
at  O
The  O
Ascot  O
is  O
rather  O
mild  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
easy  O
for  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

and  O
served  O

dish  O
made  O
with  O
shallow  O
fried  O
leftover  O
vegetables  O
known  O
as  O
Bubble  O
and  O
Squeak  O
.  O

It  O
got  O
its  O
name  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
bubbling  O
and  O
squeaking  O
sounds  O
during  O
cooking  O
.  O

other  O
than  O

today.Since  O
I  O
do  O

I  O
was  O
afraid  O
thatthe  O

be  O
too  O
sweet  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
acceptable  O
for  O
my  O
palate  O

It  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thinbatter  O
coatingwhich  O
helps  O
to  O
tone  O
down  O
the  O
sweetness  O

Kampong  O
Chicken  O
3.5/5  O

It  O
is  O
understand  O
that  O
Ipoh  O
Lou  O
Yau  O
Bean  O
Sprouts  O
Chicken  O
uses  O
only  O
free  O
range  O
kampong  O
chicken  O
imported  O
from  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Kampong  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
9.50  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O
)  O
and  O
2  O
plates  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
separately  O
for  O
$  O
2.40  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
has  O
a  O
more  O
intense  O
yellow  O
skinned  O
colour  O
compare  O
to  O
those  O
we  O
commonly  O
had  O
.  O

Besides  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
nothing  O
special  O
about  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
find  O
the  O
serving  O
a  O
bit  O
stingy  O
with  O
the  O
pricing  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O
portion  O

from  O

.  O

Blanched  O
and  O
bathed  O
in  O
a  O
savoury  O
sauce  O
,  O
the  O
bean  O
sprouts  O
were  O
definitely  O
sweeter  O
and  O
crunchier  O
from  O
the  O
north  O
.  O

Pork  O
Ball  O
Soup  O
3/5  O

I  O
realized  O
that  O
the  O
eatery  O
does  O
not  O
serve  O
soup  O
for  O
my  O
chicken  O
rice  O
,  O
so  O
I  O
separately  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
Pork  O
Ball  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
small  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
ball  O
was  O
rather  O
decent  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
am  O
quite  O
disappointed  O
with  O
Ipoh  O
Lou  O
Yau  O

Chicken  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
plate  O
of  O
generous  O
and  O
cheaper  O
Hainanese  O
chicken  O
rice  O
from  O
the  O
hawker  O
centre  O
that  O
comes  O

a  O

Due  O
to  O
new  O
development  O
at  O
Queenstown  O
with  O
the  O
closing  O
of  O
the  O
former  O
Margaret  O
Drive  O
Hawker  O
Centre  O
or  O
more  O
commonly  O
known  O
as  O
Queenstown  O
Hawker  O
Centre  O
on  O
01  O
March  O
2011  O
,  O
many  O
hawker  O
stalls  O
have  O
relocated  O
with  O
some  O
even  O
ceased  O
their  O
business  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
many  O
good  O
food  O
at  O
the  O
former  O
Margaret  O
Drive  O
hawker  O
center  O
and  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
is  O
Hai  O
Kee  O
Teochew  O
Cha  O
Kuay  O
Teow  O
.  O

After  O
doing  O
some  O
research  O
online  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
the  O
stall  O
has  O
moved  O
to  O
Telok  O
Blangah  O
Crescent  O
Market  O
&  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

So  O
with  O
my  O
camera  O
and  O
empty  O
stomach  O
,  O
Iheaded  O
downto  O
Telok  O
Blangah  O
on  O
a  O
lost  O
and  O
found  O

Char  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
4.2/5  O

Many  O
memories  O
came  O
back  O
to  O
me  O
when  O
I  O
dig  O
in  O
to  O
the  O
delicious  O
plate  O
of  O
Char  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
uncle  O
used  O
to  O
run  O
the  O
stall  O
alone  O
but  O
now  O
he  O
has  O
a  O
helper  O
helping  O
him  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
wrong  O
,  O
the  O
uncle  O
should  O
be  O
65  O
years  O
old  O
this  O
year  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
still  O
good  O
to  O
see  O
him  O
going  O
strong  O
and  O
frying  O
each  O
plate  O
individually  O
.  O

Char  O

The  O
plate  O
of  O
char  O
kway  O
teow  O
is  O
neither  O
too  O
wet  O
or  O
dry  O
,  O
for  O
my  O
standard  O
it  O
is  O
rather  O
perfect  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
a  O
fan  O
of  O
cockles  O
,  O
you  O
will  O
love  O

.  O

It  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
cockles  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
plate  O
of  O
char  O
kway  O
teow  O
does  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
fish  O
cakes  O
and  O
chinese  O

,  O
I  O

In  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O
mee  O

,  O
there  O
were  O
luxurious  O
servicing  O
of  O
crayfish  O

chicken  O

and  O
eggs  O

I  O
was  O
totally  O

the  O

the  O
spicy  O

sweet  O

The  O
gravy  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lighter  O
colour  O
,  O
smoother  O
texture  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
less  O
oily  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Malay  O
and  O
Nonya  O
versions  O

In  O
short  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
a  O
more  O
healthy  O
version  O
but  O
not  O
compromising  O
in  O
taste  O

In  O
fact  O
better  O

Before  O
leaving  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
my  O
luck  O
to  O
check  O
with  O
the  O
uncle  O
what  O
fruits  O
were  O
added  O
to  O
gravy  O
but  O
he  O
refuses  O
to  O
tell  O
me  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

He  O
only  O
tells  O
me  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
is  O
needed  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
gravy  O
and  O
it  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
boiled  O
by  O
a  O
good  O
2  O
hours  O
.  O

I  O
suspect  O
pineapple  O
and  O
lime  O
were  O
added  O
.  O

guest  O
Chef  O
Kim  O
Hyun  O
Jung  O
from  O
Lotte  O
World  O
to  O
present  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
as  O
part  O
of  O
its  O
International  O
buffet  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
already  O
quite  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
Korean  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Singapore  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
us  O
are  O
rather  O
familiar  O
with  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
worthwhile  O
to  O
visit  O
Straits  O
Cafe  O
for  O
their  O
buffet  O
as  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
prepared  O
by  O
Chef  O
Kim  O
Hyun  O
Jung  O
is  O
not  O
commonly  O
served  O
in  O
local  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Banchan  O

Banchan  O
(  O
side  O
dishes  O
)  O
is  O
like  O
astaple  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

At  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
buffet  O
,  O
the  O
spread  O
also  O
offers  O
some  O
side  O
dishes  O
such  O
as  O
Zucchini  O
,  O
Bean  O
Sprouts  O
,  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Vermicelli  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
side  O
dishes  O
is  O
the  O
kimchi  O
.  O

Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

This  O
is  O
quite  O
interesting  O
for  O
my  O
limited  O
knowledge  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
exactly  O
has  O
rice  O
in  O
it  O
and  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
having  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
porridge  O
instead  O
of  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

The  O
hearty  O
bowl  O
of  O
Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
was  O
very  O
comforting  O
with  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
chicken  O
,  O
water  O
chestnut  O
and  O
ginseng  O
.  O

One  O
can  O
also  O
add  O
a  O
pinch  O
of  O
sea  O
salt  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavour  O
further  O
.  O

Seabass  O
and  O
Zucchini  O
Pancakes  O
3.5/4  O

I  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
Seabass  O
and  O
Zucchini  O
Pancakes  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
coat  O
of  O
flour  O
and  O
egg  O
batter  O
.  O

Itwas  O
rather  O
bland  O
if  O
eaten  O
without  O
sauces  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
dipping  O
soy  O
sauce  O
that  O
made  O
the  O
pancakes  O
shone  O
,  O
accentuating  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
dimension  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Hot  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
3/5  O

Resembling  O
our  O
local  O
curry  O
chicken  O
,  O
the  O
Korean  O
version  O
of  O
Hot  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
was  O
rather  O
mild  O
and  O
fiery  O
free  O
to  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

Beef  O
Ribs  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
prime  O
Beef  O
Ribs  O
was  O
beautiful  O
marinated  O
and  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
succulent  O
and  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
.  O

Probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
diners  O
as  O
I  O
noticed  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
us  O
went  O
for  O
more  O
helpings  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
ribs  O
.  O

Rice  O
Cake  O
Roll  O
with  O
Honey  O
Citron  O
Tea  O
3/5  O

The  O
selection  O
of  O
Rice  O
Cake  O
Rolls  O
was  O
Mustard  O
(  O
yellow  O
)  O
,  O
Cinnamon  O
(  O
Brown  O
)  O
and  O
Green  O
Tea  O
(  O
green  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
chewy  O
texture  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyable  O
and  O
the  O
Honey  O
Citron  O
Tea  O
was  O
perfect  O
to  O
wash  O
it  O
down  O
and  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Laksa  O
4.5/5  O

Mentioned  O
earlier  O
,  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
is  O
just  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
International  O
Buffet  O
spread  O
at  O
Straits  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Not  O
to  O
be  O
missed  O
is  O
the  O
award  O
winning  O
Laksa  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
it  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
Daniel  O
has  O
2  O
bowls  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Definitely  O
a  O
must  O
try  O

Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
4.5/5  O

My  O
all  O
time  O
favourite  O
fish  O
steamboat  O
place  O
is  O
at  O
Nam  O
Hwa  O
Chong  O
(  O
Ah  O
Chew  O
)  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
Corner  O
(  O
)  O
at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
Jalan  O
Sultan  O
and  O
North  O
Bridge  O
Road  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
oldest  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
since  O
1927  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
said  O
by  O
many  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
the  O
creator  O
of  O
the  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
.  O

Now  O
run  O
by  O
the  O
3rd  O
generation  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
still  O
continues  O
to  O
use  O
charcoal  O
for  O
their  O
traditional  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
slurp  O
worthy  O
rich  O
and  O
sweet  O
tastes  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
fish  O
,  O
grouper  O
and  O
promfret  O
are  O
more  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
patrons  O
.  O

Oyster  O
Omelette  O
3/5  O

Beside  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
serves  O
some  O
delectable  O
Zi  O
Char  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
Oyster  O
Omelette  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
oysters  O
were  O
also  O
rather  O
small  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
3/5  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
were  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
pungent  O
prawn  O
paste  O
taste  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
milder  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
prawn  O
paste  O
chicken  O
wings  O
which  O
suit  O
those  O
who  O
dislike  O
the  O
acquire  O
prawn  O
paste  O
taste  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fried  O
Sambal  O
Tapiocal  O
Leaves  O
4/5  O

The  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Sambal  O
Tapiocal  O
Leaves  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
actually  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
but  O
fragrant  O
enough  O
,  O
not  O
overcooked  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchiness  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Roll  O
4/5  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
Prawn  O
Roll  O
too  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
packed  O
with  O
flavourful  O
filling  O
with  O
occasional  O
crunchy  O
bites  O
of  O
water  O
chestnuts  O
.  O

Thank  O
you  O
Karen  O
,  O
Maureen  O
and  O
Kai  O

the  O
birthday  O
dinner  O
treat  O

For  O
my  O
birthday  O
celebration  O
with  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
this  O
year  O
,  O
I  O
suggested  O
The  O
Clan  O
Restaurant  O
which  O
is  O
nearby  O
our  O
staycation  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
.  O

The  O
2  O
storeyrestaurant  O
is  O
nestled  O
inside  O
a  O
100  O
over  O
years  O
old  O
building  O
that  O
is  O
also  O
The  O
GAN  O
Clan  O
Association  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
interior  O
is  O
pretty  O
dark  O
so  O
pardon  O
me  O
for  O
the  O
poor  O
quality  O
photos  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
good  O
using  O
my  O
flash  O
as  O
the  O
table  O
were  O
quite  O
close  O
to  O
one  O
another  O
not  O
to  O
mention  O
the  O
dimly  O
lit  O
environment  O
.  O

Upon  O
sitting  O
down  O
,  O
we  O
werepresented  O
with  O
the  O
6  O
course  O
dinner  O
set  O
menu  O
(  O
$  O
63.80++  O
per  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
this  O
isdifferent  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
practice  O
of  O
restaurants  O
where  O
they  O
prefer  O
you  O
to  O
order  O
from  O
their  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
as  O
the  O
profit  O
margin  O
is  O
higher.Nevertheless  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
is  O
availableon  O
request.After  O
comparing  O
the  O
2menus  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
diner  O
set  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Chef  O
Starter  O
4/5  O

Before  O
starting  O
our  O
6  O
course  O
meal  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
give  O
watermelon  O
shooter  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
test  O
tube  O
to  O
whet  O
our  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
Chef  O
Starter  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
item  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
that  O
were  O
not  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
.  O

The  O
Chef  O
Starter  O
comprised  O
of  O
a  O
trio  O
which  O
for  O
me  O
the  O
most  O
memorable  O
was  O
the  O
pan  O
seared  O
scallop  O
with  O
asparagus  O
and  O
truffle  O
foam  O
.  O

Oyster  O
3  O
Ways  O
3.5/5  O

For  O
the  O
cold  O
dish  O
there  O
were  O
4  O
choices  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Alaskan  O
King  O
Crab  O
with  O
Homemade  O
Karashi  O
Dressing  O
while  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Oyster  O
3  O
Ways  O
.  O

The  O
oysters  O
were  O
fresh  O
and  O
fat  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
3  O
styles  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
oyster  O
shooter  O
with  O
quail  O
egg  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
afraid  O
that  O
therawnesswill  O
be  O
too  O
much  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
stomach  O
but  O
there  O
was  O
an  O
interesting  O
zesty  O
sauce  O
that  O
brought  O
it  O
together  O
.  O

Deep  O

3/5  O

Out  O
of  O
the  O
5  O
choices  O
available  O
for  O
the  O

Dish  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
confit  O
with  O
Pork  O
Cracker  O
&  O
Passion  O
Fruit  O
Sauce  O
while  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
,  O
Balsamico  O
Reduction  O
&  O
Cheese  O
Focaccia  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
quite  O
enjoyed  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
lost  O
its  O
shine  O
in  O
the  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
felt  O
like  O
having  O
deep  O
fried  O
wanton  O
with  O
minced  O
pork  O
filling  O
.  O

Crab  O

for  O
the  O
soup  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
another  O
4  O
choices  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O

with  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Crab  O

Love  O
the  O

as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
richness  O
and  O
robustness  O
of  O
the  O
flavours  O

choices  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
popular  O
48  O
Hours  O
Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
on  O
Hoba  O
Leaf  O
with  O
Madeira  O
Sauce  O
on  O
Lava  O
Stone  O
and  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Jawl  O
in  O
Pistachio  O
Puree  O
with  O
Pickled  O
Zucchini  O
&  O
64  O
Degree  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
cheek  O
was  O
fork  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
flavourful  O
encrusting  O
and  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
egg  O
yolk  O
coating  O
.  O

You  O
may  O
wonder  O
where  O
is  O
my  O
sixth  O
course  O
,  O
Dessert  O
?  O

Well  O
we  O
did  O
have  O
it  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
after  O
a  O
longwait  O
and  O
I  O
forgot  O
to  O
take  O
photo  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Anyway  O
there  O
are  O
5  O
choices  O
and  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
Chocolate  O
Lava  O
with  O
Raspberry  O
&  O
Homemade  O
Gelato  O
and  O
Madeira  O
Cheese  O
Panna  O
Cotta  O
.  O

Will  O
I  O
ever  O
come  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
again  O
?  O

Yes  O
I  O
will  O
.  O

Although  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
at  O
least  O
4  O
choices  O
for  O
each  O
course  O
.  O

Not  O
only  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
meticulous  O
and  O
exquisite  O
.  O

The  O
service  O
is  O
also  O
top  O
notch  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
moment  O
of  O
lapse  O
of  O
our  O
dessert  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
complaining  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
20  O
%  O
discount  O
for  O
the  O
mistake  O

After  O
our  O
restaurant  O
week  O
's  O
lunch  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O
Cuisine  O
and  O
ice  O
cream  O
at  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
,  O
Nicole  O
,  O
Kimberley  O
and  O
meended  O
up  O
at  O
Truffs  O
in  O
Telok  O
Ayer  O
.  O

Our  O
initial  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
closed  O
for  O
maintenance  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
really  O
disappointed  O
as  O
we  O
have  O
braved  O
the  O
hot  O
soaring  O
sun  O
walking  O
from  O
Raffles  O
Place  O
to  O
Telok  O
Ayer  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
moment  O
of  O
emptiness  O
in  O
us  O
until  O
Kimberley  O
suggested  O
Truffs  O
whichis  O
just  O
a  O
few  O
steps  O
away  O
.  O

Thank  O
god  O
we  O
have  O
chocolate  O
to  O
cheer  O
us  O
up  O
after  O
the  O
disappointment  O
at  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
(  O
closed  O
for  O
maintenance  O
)  O
.  O

Truff  O
is  O
located  O
on  O
the  O
second  O
floor  O
on  O
the  O
same  O
stretch  O
of  O
shophouses  O
with  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
but  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
door  O
steps  O
away  O
.  O

Kimberley  O
knows  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
because  O
she  O
bought  O
her  O
boyfriend  O
's  O
birthday  O
cake  O
from  O
Truffs  O
but  O
back  O
then  O
it  O
was  O
only  O
a  O
takeaway  O
kiosk  O
.  O

Truffs  O
has  O
since  O
expanded  O
with  O
a  O
sit  O
down  O
area  O
cum  O
gallery  O
where  O
patrons  O
can  O
enjoy  O
their  O
drinks  O
and  O
indulge  O
in  O
their  O
signature  O
cakes  O
and  O
tarts  O
.  O

Ice  O
Chocolate  O
4.2/5  O
Hot  O
Chocolate  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
think  O
this  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
chocolate  O
beverage  O
I  O
ever  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Hot  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
while  O
the  O
ladies  O
had  O
the  O
Ice  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
beverages  O
were  O
velvety  O
,  O
rich  O
but  O
yet  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

The  O
ice  O
chocolate  O
even  O
comes  O
with  O
dark  O
chocolate  O
bits  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Cake  O
4.5/5  O

I  O
am  O
grateful  O
that  O
Truffsnow  O
has  O
a  O
caf  O
area  O
so  O
I  O
gota  O
chance  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
delicious  O
Chocolate  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
11  O
per  O
slice  O
)  O
.  O

When  O
they  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
caf  O
area  O
,  O
one  O
needs  O
to  O
buy  O
the  O
whole  O
cake  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
taste  O
this  O
delicious  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
fluffy  O
and  O
spongy  O
while  O
the  O
ganache  O
was  O
rich  O
but  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
harmonised  O
balance  O
thatI  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
sick  O
finishing  O
it  O
.  O

Earl  O
Grey  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
4/5  O

The  O
tart  O
at  O
Truffs  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
bottom  O
shell  O
but  O
replaced  O
with  O
a  O
crumbly  O
crusts  O
.  O

The  O
tart  O
comes  O
in  O
either  O
Earl  O
Grey  O
or  O
Espresso  O
infused  O
chocolate  O
ganache  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Earl  O
Grey  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
7  O
)  O
which  O
hasa  O
brilliant  O
combination  O
of  O
the  O
intense  O
and  O
velvety  O
tea  O
infused  O
chocolate  O
ganache  O
.  O

Truffs  O
is  O
definitely  O
a  O
chocolate  O
heaven  O
for  O
chocolate  O
lovers  O
for  O
their  O
exquisite  O
truffles  O
,  O
cakes  O
and  O
tarts  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
caf  O
area  O
is  O
rather  O
spacious  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
owner  O
did  O
not  O
fill  O
up  O
the  O
space  O
with  O
more  O
tables  O
and  O
seats  O
to  O
make  O
more  O
profit  O
.  O

The  O
caf  O
area  O
has  O
a  O
quiet  O
and  O
laid  O
back  O
charm  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
imagine  O
myself  O
relaxing  O
,  O
reading  O
a  O
book  O
while  O
sipping  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
hot  O
chocolate  O
.  O

The  O
Milk  O
flavour  O

pretty  O
normal  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
chocolate  O

nuts  O

give  O
the  O

an  O

My  O
previous  O
visit  O
to  O
Azur  O
was  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
ago  O
for  O
a  O
corporate  O
lunch  O
when  O
Crowne  O
Plaza  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
was  O
newly  O
built  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
was  O
quite  O
extensive  O
showcasing  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
local  O
favourites  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Azur  O
at  O
Crowne  O
Plaza  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
their  O
new  O
Weekend  O
Changi  O
Brunch  O
menu  O
.  O

Azur  O
has  O
brought  O
together  O
the  O
best  O
of  O
the  O
East  O
and  O
West  O
in  O
a  O
refreshed  O
menu  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
Weekend  O

local  O
and  O

.  O

Sausages  O
with  O
Juniper  O
Berry  O
Sauerkraut  O
and  O
Beef  O
Jus  O
4.5/5  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
memorable  O
items  O
I  O
tried  O
at  O
the  O
brunch  O
buffet  O
is  O
the  O
German  O
Sausages  O
with  O
Juniper  O
Berry  O
Sauerkraut  O
and  O
Beef  O
Jus  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
sauerkraut  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
have  O
combination  O
for  O
eating  O
sausages  O
.  O

Some  O
restaurants  O
only  O
served  O
sausages  O
with  O
mustard  O
.  O

Iam  O
delight  O
that  O
Azur  O
took  O
the  O
effort  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
juniper  O
berry  O
sauerkraut  O
.  O

herb  O
.  O

with  O
Yuzu  O
Orange  O
Sauce  O

The  O
Pan  O
Seared  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
was  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
Yuzu  O
Orange  O
Sauce  O
.  O

The  O
moistfish  O
was  O
further  O

by  O
the  O
tangy  O

.  O

with  O
Homemade  O
Chilli  O
Sauce  O
3/5  O

The  O

Sauce  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
,  O
succulent  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Oh  O

Love  O
the  O

which  O
was  O

Bar.A  O
good  O
change  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
Laksa  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
thought  O
the  O

still  O
a  O
better  O
representation  O
of  O
the  O
local  O
favourite  O
.  O

Cold  O

I  O
love  O
the  O
array  O
of  O
Asian  O

I  O
do  O
n't  O
have  O
a  O
huge  O
stomach  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
delectable  O
food  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
3  O
rounds  O
only  O
while  O
the  O
others  O
were  O
shared  O
with  O
my  O
dining  O

,  O
Baked  O
Mussels  O

.  O

Dessert  O

Definitely  O
we  O

the  O
sumptuous  O
lunch  O

The  O
enclave  O
at  O
Jalan  O
Riang  O
off  O
Upper  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
sees  O
another  O
new  O
food  O
establishment  O
,  O
Rokeby  O
(  O
roc-ker-bee  O
)  O
named  O
after  O
a  O
street  O
in  O
Western  O
Australia  O
opened  O
its  O
door  O
about  O
2  O
months  O
back  O
.  O

The  O
Australian  O
inspired  O
bistro  O
is  O
opened  O
by  O
a  O
young  O
couple  O
,  O
Kelvin  O
and  O
Denyse  O
serving  O
delectable  O
gourmet  O
food  O
and  O
artisan  O
coffee  O
.  O

For  O
authenticity  O
,  O
Rokeby  O
imports  O
Australia  O
roasted  O
coffee  O
beans  O
from  O
Five  O
Senses  O
,  O
artisanal  O
teas  O
from  O
Tea  O
Drop  O
Australia  O
,  O
wines  O
from  O
Sandalford  O
in  O
Swan  O
Valley  O
and  O
Aussie  O
beers  O
.  O

The  O
bistro  O
has  O
a  O
relax  O
and  O
chill  O
ambience  O
with  O
both  O
indoor  O
and  O
outdoor  O
seating  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
kids  O
'  O
corner  O
to  O
cater  O
to  O
youngs  O
one  O
while  O
the  O
adults  O
can  O
indulge  O
in  O
their  O
meal  O
.  O

Flat  O
White  O
4/5  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
Flat  O
White  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
)  O
to  O
kick  O
start  O
my  O
day  O
.  O

I  O
do  O
n't  O
like  O
my  O
coffee  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
acidic  O
hence  O
I  O
quite  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
cup  O
of  O
coffee  O
at  O
Rokeby  O
which  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
bitter  O
for  O
some  O
.  O

Full  O
Monty  O
Brekkie  O
3.8/5  O

All  O
of  O
us  O
ordered  O
from  O
the  O
brunch  O
menu  O
hence  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
ofinjustice  O
to  O
the  O
bistro  O
in  O
this  O
review  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
this  O
was  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
items  O
we  O
ordered  O
from  O
the  O
weekend  O
brunch  O
menu  O
till  O
3pm  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
hungry  O
stomach  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
Full  O
Monty  O
Brekkie  O
(  O
$  O
17.90  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
2  O
eggs  O
served  O
with  O
2  O
bratwurst  O
sausages  O
,  O
bacon  O
,  O
hashbrown  O
,  O

tomato  O
,  O

beans  O
,  O

and  O

.  O

French  O
Toast  O
3/5  O

For  O
the  O
light-eaters  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
French  O
Toast  O
(  O
$  O
7.90  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
2  O
eggs  O
on  O
toast  O
served  O
with  O
salad  O
and  O
baked  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Ham  O
and  O
Cheese  O
Omelette  O
3.5/5  O

Actually  O
my  O
friend  O
and  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
order  O
the  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
but  O
after  O
taking  O
our  O
orders  O
,  O
the  O
waitress  O
came  O
back  O
5  O
minutes  O
later  O
informing  O
us  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
poached  O
eggs  O
,  O
asking  O
us  O
to  O
change  O
to  O
scrambled  O
egg  O
or  O
other  O
style  O
of  O
eggs  O
for  O
our  O
egg  O
benedict  O
?  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
quite  O
weird  O
since  O
the  O
kitchen  O
can  O
prepare  O
other  O
styles  O
of  O
egg  O
but  O
not  O
poached  O
egg  O
.  O

Anyway  O
my  O
friend  O
changed  O
her  O
order  O
and  O
had  O
the  O
Ham  O
and  O
Cheese  O
Omelette  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
that  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
salad  O
,  O
baked  O
beans  O
and  O
toast  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Vegemite  O
Downunder  O
3.8/5  O

What  O
is  O
egg  O
benedict  O
without  O
poached  O
eggs  O
so  O
I  O
also  O
changed  O
my  O
order  O
to  O
Vegemite  O
Downunder  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
.  O

This  O
brought  O
back  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
childhood  O
memories  O
when  O
I  O
used  O
to  O
spread  O
my  O
toast  O
with  O
vegemite  O
.  O

Paired  O
with  O
the  O
creamy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
with  O
salad  O
and  O
baked  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
hearty  O
breakfast  O
the  O
Aussie  O
way  O
.  O

The  O
brunch  O
menu  O
at  O
Rokeby  O
is  O
pretty  O
decent  O
but  O
service  O
was  O
pretty  O
slow  O
.  O

Considering  O
the  O
kitchen  O
is  O
pretty  O
small  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
only  O
2  O
months  O
into  O
operations  O
,  O
hopefully  O
it  O
can  O
only  O
get  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
bistro  O
and  O
try  O
their  O
mains  O
when  O
operations  O
are  O
smooth  O
running  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
plan  O
to  O
make  O
any  O
reservation  O
for  O
this  O
year  O
Restaurant  O
Week  O
March  O
2013  O
since  O
I  O
felt  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
offered  O
in  O
Restaurant  O
Week  O
werecompromised  O
.  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
I  O
end  O
up  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O
Cuisine  O
?  O

If  O
I  O
remembered  O
correctly  O
,  O
it  O
all  O
started  O
with  O
Daniel  O
tweeting  O
his  O
restaurant  O
week  O
's  O
experience  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O
Cuisine  O
.  O

That  O
started  O
a  O
chain  O
of  O
conversations  O
on  O
Twitter  O
with  O
some  O
friends  O
and  O
eventually  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
making  O
reservation  O
for  O
a  O
weekday  O
lunch  O
with  O
Charleen  O
,  O
Nicole  O
and  O
Kimberley  O
.  O

Carpaccio  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
4.5/5  O

For  O
the  O
starter  O
,  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Carpaccio  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
in  O
Tartate  O
Style  O
.  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
beautiful  O
marbled  O
wagyu  O
beef  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
medley  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
accentuated  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
.  O

Cold  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
4.8/5  O

The  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Cold  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
which  O
was  O
a  O
rendition  O
of  O
their  O
signature  O
Cold  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
with  O
Oscietra  O
Caviar  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
cold  O
plate  O
.  O

The  O
cold  O
plate  O
simply  O
shows  O
the  O
details  O
the  O
chef  O
has  O
put  O
into  O
his  O
dish  O
.  O

Even  O
without  O
the  O
caviar  O
which  O
was  O
substituted  O
with  O
tomato  O
,  O
mozzarella  O
and  O
ham  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
nothing  O
shy  O
of  O
excellent  O
.  O

Pan-Roasted  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
4.5/5  O

For  O
an  O
additional  O
$  O
15  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Pan  O
Roasted  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
which  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
almond  O
bits  O
.  O

The  O
crunchy  O
almond  O
bits  O
not  O
only  O
given  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
a  O
nice  O
contrast  O
in  O
texture  O
,  O
it  O
also  O
given  O
it  O
a  O
nutty  O
flavour  O
that  O
lifted  O
the  O
whole  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
the  O
delicacy  O
.  O

Pork  O
Ribs  O
in  O
Provencale  O
Style  O
4.8/5  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
main  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
awesome  O
pork  O
ribs  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
had  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
while  O
.  O

The  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
done  O
in  O
Provencale  O
Style  O
was  O
so  O
tender  O
and  O
full  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
the  O
huge  O
slab  O
itself  O
was  O
not  O
enough  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
simply  O
go  O
for  O
another  O
piece  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Brittany  O
Cod  O
Fish  O
,  O
Couscous  O
of  O
Vegetables  O
4/5  O

For  O
the  O
other  O
main  O
,  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Brittany  O
Cod  O
Fish  O
with  O
Couscous  O
of  O
Vegetables  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
milder  O
in  O
taste  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O
bold  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
pork  O
ribs  O
.  O

The  O
delicately  O
cooked  O
piece  O
of  O
cod  O
fish  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
smokiness  O
.  O

English  O
Breakfast  O
Tea  O
Bavarois  O
4/5  O

For  O
the  O
dessert  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
not  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
and  O
was  O
served  O
the  O
English  O
Breakfast  O
Tea  O
Bavarois  O
.  O

The  O
flavourful  O
custard  O
set  O
with  O
gelatine  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
lingering  O
tea  O
taste  O
that  O
was  O
complemented  O
by  O
the  O
salty  O
caramel  O
and  O
lemongrass  O
infused  O
sauce  O
.  O

Petit  O
Fours  O
3.8/5  O

For  O
the  O
Petit  O
Fours  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Almond  O
Cracker  O
,  O
Madeleine  O
and  O
Dark  O
Chocolate  O
Praline  O
.  O

Pardon  O
my  O
ignorance  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
puzzled  O
,  O
there  O
was  O
only  O
3  O
items  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
right  O
?  O

Paired  O
with  O
my  O

,  O
it  O
was  O
nevertheless  O
a  O

to  O
a  O

There  O
was  O
a  O

of  O
excitement  O

this  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
excited  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
the  O
dim  O
sum  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
and  O
I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
Chef  O
Mak  O
has  O
decided  O
to  O
bring  O
it  O
to  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Now  O
I  O
can  O
just  O
hop  O
on  O
a  O
MRT  O
instead  O
of  O
a  O
plane  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
famed  O
dim  O

of  O

Dine  O
In  O
Area  O

The  O
restaurant  O
at  O
Plaza  O
Singapura  O
is  O
divided  O
in  O
two  O
sections  O
.  O

A  O
dine-in  O
area  O
that  O
can  O
sit  O
up  O
to  O
100  O
customers  O
and  O
a  O
takeaway  O
counter  O
that  O
offers  O
an  O
express  O
service  O
for  O
customers  O
who  O
wish  O
to  O
bring  O
home  O
their  O
favourite  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

There  O
will  O
be  O
no  O
reservation  O
at  O
Tim  O

It  O
will  O
follow  O
the  O
practised  O
by  O
its  O
predecessors  O
,  O
seating  O
will  O
be  O
on  O
a  O
first  O
come  O
first  O
served  O
basis  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
also  O
implemented  O
a  O

and  O
SMS  O
system  O
if  O
the  O
waiting  O
time  O
is  O
too  O
long  O
.  O

Patrons  O

In  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Cantopop  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
Four  O
Heavenly  O
Kings  O
(  O
)  O
namely  O
Jacky  O
Cheung  O
,  O
Aaron  O

Andy  O

and  O
Leon  O

.  O

At  O
Tim  O
Ho  O

Hong  O
Kong  O
also  O
has  O
its  O
famed  O
Big  O
4  O
Heavenly  O
Kings  O
(  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
.  O

They  O
are  O
the  O
famous  O

also  O
available  O
at  O
the  O

branch  O
.  O

Pan  O
Fried  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
Chef  O
Mak  O
's  O
interview  O
he  O
correctly  O
pointed  O
out  O
that  O
Singaporean  O
prefers  O
fried  O
stuff  O
which  O
is  O
why  O
there  O
was  O
mix  O
opinions  O
with  O
the  O
Pan  O
Fried  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
for  O
3pc  O
)  O
at  O
my  O
table  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
us  O
prefer  O
the  O
fried  O
style  O
where  O
the  O
carrot  O
cake  O
is  O
more  O
crisp  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
the  O
opposite  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
my  O
carrot  O
cake  O
steamed  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
pan  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
was  O
well  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
layer  O
of  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
was  O
still  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
with  O
shreds  O
of  O
radish  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Egg  O
Cake  O
4.8/5  O

Resembling  O
the  O
Chinese  O
Steamed  O
Cake  O
(  O
Huat  O
Kueh  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3.80  O
for  O
1pc  O
)  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

A  O
distinct  O
egg  O
taste  O
which  O
felt  O
like  O
eating  O
Tamago  O
while  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
spongy  O
like  O
a  O
cake  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
eaten  O
anything  O
like  O
it  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
Pig  O
's  O
Liver  O
4/5  O

A  O
bold  O
twist  O
from  O
the  O
tradition  O
where  O
vermicelli  O
roll  O
is  O
commonly  O
stuffed  O
with  O
char  O
siew  O
or  O
shrimp  O
,  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
Pig  O
's  O
Liver  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
velvety  O
texture  O
while  O
the  O
fresh  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
soft  O
.  O

Another  O
dim  O
sum  O
dish  O
that  O
you  O
will  O
not  O
find  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
Chef  O
Mak  O
mentioned  O
in  O
one  O
of  O
his  O
interviews  O
,  O
he  O
has  O
tested  O
the  O
local  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
until  O
he  O
was  O
satisfied  O
with  O
the  O
texture  O
although  O
there  O
is  O
still  O
a  O
slight  O
different  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
's  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
which  O
is  O
even  O
more  O
tender  O
.  O

Baked  O
Bun  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
5/5  O

The  O
marquee  O
dish  O
of  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
that  O
has  O
transformed  O
the  O
eatery  O
into  O
a  O
mecca  O
is  O
the  O
famed  O
Baked  O
Bun  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
for  O
3pc  O
)  O
.  O

Everyone  O
on  O
our  O
table  O
was  O
eagerly  O
waiting  O
for  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
.  O

I  O
already  O
have  O
the  O
expectation  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
good  O
but  O
sinking  O
my  O
teeth  O
into  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
way  O
beyond  O
my  O
description  O
of  O
just  O
good  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
excellently  O
awesome  O
.  O

Even  O
those  O
that  O
have  O
tried  O
the  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
's  O
branch  O
gave  O
the  O
thumbs  O
up  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
exterior  O
of  O
the  O
bun  O
was  O
crumbly  O
and  O
pillowy  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
boasted  O
a  O
sweet-salty  O
taste  O
of  O
oozing  O
barbecued  O
pork  O
.  O

Yes  O
I  O
loving  O
it  O
so  O
much  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
giving  O
it  O
5  O
out  O
of  O
5  O
,  O
first  O
time  O
since  O
I  O
started  O
this  O
blog  O

We  O
love  O
the  O
Baked  O
Bun  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
so  O
much  O
that  O
we  O
ordered  O
more  O
and  O
its  O
a  O
lot  O
more  O

Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
4/5  O

Besides  O
the  O
vermicelli  O
roll  O
with  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
,  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
also  O
serves  O
4  O
other  O
vermicelli  O
rolls  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
,  O
Shrimp  O
,  O
Beef  O
or  O
Vegetarian  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
consistent  O
velvety  O
texture  O
paired  O
excellently  O
with  O
the  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
.  O

Dumpling  O
Teochew  O
Style  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
ended  O
up  O
eating  O
the  O
Dumpling  O
Teochew  O
Style  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
for  O
3pc  O
)  O
myself  O
because  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
at  O
my  O
table  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
the  O
Chinese  O
chives  O
in  O
the  O
dumpling  O
.  O

Maybe  O
because  O
I  O
am  O
a  O
Teochew  O
,  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
deft  O
piece  O
of  O
work  O
redolent  O
of  O
both  O
the  O
Soon  O
Kueh  O
and  O
Gu  O
Chai  O
Kueh  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
4/5  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
or  O
Har  O
Gow  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
was  O
extremely  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
patrons  O
.  O

The  O
thin  O
and  O
translucent  O
skin  O
was  O
smooth  O
but  O
yet  O
sturdy  O
wrapping  O
the  O
succulent  O
prawn  O
which  O
was  O
so  O
addictive  O
that  O
we  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
item  O
to  O
be  O
sold  O
out  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

Pork  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shrimp  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shrimp  O
or  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
was  O
delicately  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
balancedproportion  O
of  O
ground  O
pork  O
and  O
shrimp  O
.  O

While  O
others  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
saltiness  O
which  O
I  O
covered  O
by  O
dipping  O
into  O
the  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
.  O

Beef  O

The  O
Beef  O
Ball  O
with  O
Beancurd  O
Skin  O
(  O
$  O
4.20  O
for  O
3pc  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
least  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
majority  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
at  O
my  O
table  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
beef  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
taste  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
mild  O
for  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

Spring  O
Roll  O
with  O

The  O
Spring  O
Roll  O
with  O
Egg  O
White  O
(  O
$  O
4.20  O
for  O
3pc  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
vegetable  O
filling  O
.  O

Deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
beautiful  O
golden  O
brown  O
,  O
the  O
spring  O
roll  O
was  O
crispy  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
complemented  O
with  O
the  O
creamy  O
egg  O
white  O
filling  O
.  O

Tonic  O

Osmanthus  O
Cake  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
expect  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
to  O
offer  O
desserts  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
Tonic  O
Medlar  O
&  O
Osmanthus  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
for  O
3  O
pc  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
gelatinous  O
and  O
not  O
overpowering  O
sweet  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
helped  O
to  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Since  O
its  O
opening  O
on  O
10  O

2013  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
expected  O
since  O
the  O

is  O
cheap  O
and  O
affordable  O
,  O
ranging  O
from  O

3.80  O

The  O
dish  O
smelled  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
we  O
asked  O
the  O

whether  O
we  O
can  O
have  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
rice  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
it  O

After  O

,  O
it  O
was  O
our  O
time  O
to  O
cook  O
our  O
own  O
family  O
recipe  O
dish  O
.  O

Vicki  O
and  O
me  O
has  O
been  O
brainstorming  O
for  O
a  O
simple  O
dish  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
handle  O
within  O
our  O
culinary  O
ability  O
.  O

After  O
consulting  O
with  O
Vicki  O
's  O
mum  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
cook  O
Golden  O
Sands  O
French  O
Beans  O
.  O

We  O
even  O
practiced  O
the  O
dish  O
the  O
night  O
before  O
so  O
that  O
we  O
do  O
n't  O
make  O
a  O
fool  O
of  O
ourselves  O
in  O
the  O
blogger  O
cookout  O

turned  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
noticed  O
a  O
crowd  O
at  O
Song  O
Kee  O
Fishball  O
Noodle  O
along  O
Upper  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
whenever  O
I  O
am  O
on  O
my  O
way  O
home  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

Managed  O
to  O
ask  O
a  O
friend  O
who  O
stays  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
one  O
evening  O
to  O
join  O
me  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
place  O
around  O
1130pm  O
,  O
the  O
place  O
was  O
already  O
pretty  O
crowded  O
with  O
many  O
tables  O
waiting  O
for  O
their  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
30  O
minutes  O
and  O
indeed  O
I  O
did  O
.  O

Mee  O
Kia  O
Dry  O
4/5  O

We  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
Mee  O
Kia  O
Dry  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
and  O
Mee  O
Pok  O
Dry  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
.  O

Each  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
came  O
with  O
3  O
fishballs  O
,  O
a  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
(  O
Her  O
Giao  O
)  O
and  O
a  O
Tao  O
Pok  O
stuffed  O
with  O
fish  O
paste  O
.  O

The  O
noodles  O
and  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
were  O
rather  O
normal  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
their  O
ingredients  O
and  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
pork  O
lard  O
.  O

Mee  O
Pok  O
Dry  O
4/5  O

The  O
fishball  O
that  O
is  O
about  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
a  O
ping  O
pong  O
ball  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
yellowtail  O
.  O

The  O
fishball  O
was  O
springy  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
(  O
Her  O
Giao  O
)  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

Biting  O
into  O
the  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
,  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
shallot  O
oil  O
from  O
the  O
filling  O
simply  O
filled  O
the  O
whole  O
mouth  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
visit  O
I  O
can  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
them  O
in  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
been  O
observing  O
but  O
still  O
ca  O
n't  O
figure  O
out  O
why  O
the  O
uncle  O
takes  O
so  O
long  O
to  O
cook  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
.  O

His  O
motion  O
was  O
pretty  O
fast  O
and  O
it  O
does  O
n't  O
seem  O
to  O
have  O
unnecessary  O
action  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
visit  O
Song  O
Kee  O
Fishball  O
Noodle  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
crowd  O
,  O
proceed  O
to  O
make  O
your  O
order  O
and  O
take  O
a  O
queue  O
number  O
first  O
before  O
finding  O
a  O
seat  O
.  O

The  O
wait  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
long  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
drinks  O
you  O
can  O
take  O
it  O
yourself  O
from  O
the  O
fridge  O
first  O
.  O

Just  O
pay  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
noodle  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
served  O

Original  O
Sin  O
the  O
first  O
vegetarian  O
Mediterranean  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
14  O
years  O
since  O
1997.Chef  O
Michael  O
Hadley  O
from  O
Michelangelo  O
together  O
with  O
co-owner  O
Chef  O
Marisa  O
Bertocchi  O
created  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
Original  O
Sin  O
and  O
since  O
then  O
never  O
look  O
back  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
really  O
quite  O
an  O
achievement  O
for  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
restaurant  O
in  O
the  O
current  O
F  O
&  O
B  O
scene  O
where  O
restaurants  O
opened  O
and  O
closed  O
in  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
.  O

Principessa  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
colorful  O
salad  O
garden  O
,  O
Principessa  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
has  O
an  O
eclectic  O
mix  O
of  O
roasted  O
pumpkin  O
,  O
avocado  O
,  O
asparagus  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
and  O
boccocini  O
,  O
all  O
mingled  O
in  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
mixed  O
lettuces  O
and  O
dressed  O
in  O
a  O
light  O
balsamic  O
vinaigrette  O
that  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
unassuming  O
.  O

Basilico  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Basilico  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
is  O
homemade  O
herb  O
bread  O
with  O
creamy  O
goat  O
cheese  O
,  O
char  O
grilled  O
eggplant  O
and  O
roasted  O
capsicum  O
and  O
rocket  O
leaves  O
.  O

The  O
bruschetta  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
balanced  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
will  O
whet  O
your  O
appetite  O
.  O

Fritters  O
3/5  O

The  O
Eggplant  O
and  O
Parsnip  O
Fritters  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
drizzled  O
with  O
zesty  O
house  O
mayo  O
was  O
rather  O
simple  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
batter  O
but  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
quite  O
delectable  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
exterior  O
crisp  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
parsnip  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
texture  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
potato  O
,  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Haloumi  O
3/5  O

The  O
Haloumi  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
usually  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
goat  O
's  O
milk  O
and  O
sheep  O
's  O
milk  O
was  O
nicely  O
pan  O
fried  O
and  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
salad  O
greens  O
,  O
roasted  O
capsicum  O
,  O
lentil  O
,  O
cucumber  O
and  O
mint  O
salad  O
.  O

Due  O
to  O
its  O
high  O
melting  O
point  O
,  O
the  O
haloumi  O
is  O
ideal  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
pan  O
fried  O
or  O
grilled  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O
texture  O
and  O
alternate  O
way  O
to  O
enjoy  O
cheese  O
.  O

Mezze  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
Mezze  O
Platter  O
(  O
$  O

reminds  O
me  O
of  O
a  O
similar  O
dish  O
I  O
had  O
at  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
.  O

The  O
Middle  O
Eastern  O
platter  O
served  O
with  O
Falafal  O
balls  O
and  O

the  O
pumpkin  O
and  O
carrot  O
dip  O
.  O

spinach  O
,  O
pesto  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
tomato  O
basil  O
sauce  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
was  O
simply  O
magical  O
.  O

The  O
medley  O
of  O
rich  O
flavours  O
with  O
the  O
earthy  O
mushroom  O
magically  O
sent  O
the  O
mouth  O
blooming  O

dish  O
at  O
Original  O
Sin  O
.  O

The  O
Bosco  O
Misto  O
(  O

)  O
is  O
like  O
2  O
beef  O
patties  O
stacked  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
each  O
other  O
but  O
this  O
is  O
the  O

made  O
of  O

coated  O
with  O
crushed  O
almonds  O
and  O
sesame  O
seeds  O
,  O

a  O
button  O
mushroom  O
plum  O

Being  O
a  O
meat  O
lover  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
actually  O
very  O
satisfied  O
and  O
content  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
I  O
missed  O
out  O
any  O
meat  O
.  O

all  O
the  O
dishes  O
,  O
the  O
Vegetable  O
Tandoori  O

is  O
probably  O
too  O
vegetarian  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

char  O
grilled  O

mushroom  O

beautiful  O
flavours  O
.  O

By  O

I  O
am  O
already  O
very  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
creativity  O

.  O

She  O
definitely  O
has  O
bring  O
vegetarian  O

to  O
a  O

level  O
.  O

Cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
,  O
the  O

(  O
$  O
26  O
)  O
was  O
exquisitely  O
executed  O
.  O

The  O
creamy  O
white  O
wine  O

also  O
married  O
the  O

beautifully  O

together  O
.  O

minutes  O
to  O
cook  O
your  O
Risotto  O
(  O
$  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
definitely  O
worth  O
every  O
minutes  O
of  O
the  O
wait  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O

have  O
ever  O
tried  O

Being  O
able  O
to  O
stand  O
tall  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
14  O
years  O
,  O
Original  O

tapped  O
on  O
a  O

segment  O
of  O
the  O
market  O
and  O
brings  O
vegetarian  O
to  O
a  O
whole  O
new  O
level  O
with  O
its  O
creativity  O
.  O

Vegetarian  O
food  O
is  O
no  O
more  O
boring  O
and  O
even  O
better  O
than  O
many  O
non  O
vegetarian  O
food  O
.  O

Price  O
can  O
be  O
on  O
the  O
high  O
side  O

The  O

with  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O

the  O
burnt  O
rice  O
grains  O
.  O

The  O
unagi  O
was  O
also  O
well  O

it  O
ca  O

be  O
short  O
of  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
Omu  O
Curry  O
Rice  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
that  O
came  O
with  O

stewed  O
in  O
Japanese  O
curry  O
served  O
with  O

ca  O
n't  O
get  O
enough  O
of  O
the  O
delectable  O
skewer  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O

,  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
order  O
them  O
from  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
Pork  O

)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
side  O
of  O

.  O

Beautifully  O
marinated  O

the  O

had  O
a  O
smoky  O
flavour  O
and  O

Belly  O
Toji  O
4/5  O

The  O
UnagiBelly  O
Toji  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
with  O
a  O
medley  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
has  O
unagi  O
,  O
cherry  O
tomato  O
,  O
wolfberries  O

also  O
offers  O

of  O

items  O
is  O
the  O
Smoked  O

with  O
cheese  O
,  O
smoked  O
salmon  O
and  O
poached  O
egg  O
drizzled  O
with  O
Hollandaise  O
sauce  O
.  O

Lovely  O
flavours  O
but  O
just  O
a  O
tad  O
disappointed  O
that  O
the  O
poached  O
egg  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
over  O
,  O
no  O
runny  O
egg  O
yolk  O
.  O

Macha  O

(  O
$  O
13.50  O
)  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
fluffy  O
and  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

The  O
cakes  O
were  O
all  O
freshly  O
made  O

high  O

Dessert  O
Bento  O
3.5/5  O

For  O
those  O
that  O
ca  O
n't  O
decide  O
what  O
to  O
order  O
for  O
dessert  O
,  O
the  O
Dessert  O
Bento  O
(  O
$  O
19.90  O
)  O
allows  O
you  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
try  O
of  O
everything  O
.  O

The  O
dessert  O
bento  O
comes  O
with  O
shiratama  O
,  O
panna  O
cotta  O
,  O
gelato  O
,  O
gyuuhi  O
and  O
cake  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
bento  O
box  O
.  O

The  O
new  O
concept  O
of  O
Japanese-Italian  O
cafe  O
by  O
MOF  O
sounds  O
interestingly  O
but  O
most  O
the  O
items  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
are  O
still  O
vastly  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
inspired  O
.  O

Nothing  O
really  O
unique  O
in  O
their  O
dishes  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
or  O
tried  O
in  O
other  O
local  O
restaurants/cafes  O
,  O
probably  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
bird  O
cages  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
pretty  O
good  O
and  O
worth  O
a  O
visit  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
their  O
savoury  O
more  O
than  O
their  O
sweet  O
stuff  O
.  O

I  O
was  O

break  O
at  O

around  O

Nicole  O
suggested  O
we  O
checked  O
this  O
new  O
noodle  O
stall  O
.  O

It  O
was  O

get  O

Opened  O
in  O
February  O
2013  O
by  O
a  O
duo  O
trained  O
in  O
Shatec  O
,  O
the  O
pair  O
of  O
noodles  O
lovers  O
created  O
their  O
very  O
own  O
local  O
style  O
Singapore  O
ramen  O
,  O
gourmet  O
quality  O
noodles  O
at  O
hawker  O
prices  O
using  O
modern  O
culinary  O
techniques  O
and  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
.  O

A  O
bowl  O
of  O
the  O
noodle  O
costs  O
$  O
5/  O
$  O
6/  O
$  O
7  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
really  O
quite  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
consider  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
ingredients  O
that  O
come  O
with  O
the  O
noodle  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
Singapore  O
style  O
ramen  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Style  O
Wonton  O
,  O
Freshly  O
Sliced  O
Scallions  O
,  O
Cha  O
Su  O
,  O
Crispy  O
Potato  O
Wrapped  O
Prawn  O
,  O
Hot  O
Spring  O
Egg  O
and  O
of  O
course  O
the  O
Springy  O
Noodles  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
the  O
stall  O
was  O
using  O
Wu  O
Hua  O
Rou  O
for  O
their  O
Cha  O
Su  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
2  O
weeks  O
for  O
the  O
leaner  O
meat  O
but  O
will  O
be  O
switching  O
back  O
to  O
pork  O
belly  O
for  O
its  O
aroma  O
and  O
tenderness  O
.  O

The  O
crispy  O
potato  O
wrapped  O
prawn  O
is  O
quite  O
unique  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
having  O
fried  O
prawn  O
wrapped  O
by  O
rosti  O
.  O

Singapore  O
Style  O
Ramen  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
stall  O
has  O
created  O
this  O
simple  O
yet  O
complicated  O
dish  O
specially  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

It  O
is  O
because  O
the  O
simplest  O
dish  O
to  O
make  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
most  O
complicated  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
it  O
is  O
either  O
you  O
hate  O
it  O
or  O
like  O
it  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

The  O
reason  O
is  O
the  O
noodle  O
.  O

In  O
terms  O
of  O
texture  O
the  O
thin  O
noodles  O
really  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
springy  O
and  O
enjoyable  O
texture  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
has  O
an  O
alkaline  O
taste  O
that  O
was  O
still  O
acceptable  O
to  O
me  O
but  O
may  O
not  O
for  O
many  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
still  O
pretty  O
new  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
going  O
through  O
refinement  O
and  O
adjustment  O
of  O
the  O
ultimate  O
noodle  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
for  O
the  O
stall  O
to  O
achieve  O
the  O
dream  O
of  O
serving  O
their  O
Singapore  O
style  O
ramen  O
not  O
only  O
to  O
the  O
locals  O
but  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
world  O

with  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
super  O
belated  O
post  O
.  O

Last  O
Christmas  O
,  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
us  O
went  O
to  O
Batam  O
for  O
our  O
annual  O
Christmas  O
gathering  O
.  O

My  O
friend  O
suggested  O
Montigo  O
Resorts  O
Nongsa  O
in  O
Batam  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
heard  O
of  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
know  O
of  O
Harris  O
and  O
Holiday  O
Inn  O
Hotel  O
.  O

Apparently  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
a  O
new  O
property  O
about  O
a  O
year  O
old  O
labeling  O
itself  O
as  O
5  O
stars  O
luxury  O
resort  O
in  O
Batam  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
check  O
in  O
lobby  O
of  O
Montigo  O
Resorts  O
Nongsa  O
Batam  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
is  O
really  O
beautiful  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
see  O
Singapore  O
across  O
the  O
sea  O
and  O
even  O
spotted  O
Marina  O
Bay  O
Sands  O
.  O

A  O
map  O
of  O
the  O
resort  O
.  O

The  O
villas  O
are  O
all  O
built  O
along  O
the  O
1  O
kilometer  O
stretch  O
of  O
private  O
beach  O
facing  O
the  O
South  O
China  O
Sea  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
private  O
beach  O
is  O
still  O
not  O
fully  O
completed  O
when  O
we  O
were  O
there  O
.  O

The  O
beach  O
and  O
water  O
was  O
muddy  O
.  O

Upon  O
checking  O
in  O
,  O
we  O
are  O
transported  O
to  O
our  O
3  O
storey  O
villa  O
by  O
buddy  O
.  O

The  O
first  O
floor  O
considers  O
of  O
the  O
living  O
hall  O
,  O
a  O
toilet  O
,  O
a  O
kitchen  O
bar  O
,  O
balcony  O
and  O
pool  O
.  O

Balcony  O
area  O
with  O
an  O
infinity  O
pool  O
facing  O
the  O
sea  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
2  O
bedrooms  O
on  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
master  O
bedroom  O
which  O
is  O
really  O
spacious  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
view  O
from  O
the  O
master  O
bedroom  O
.  O

The  O
left  O
side  O
is  O
the  O
spa  O
villa  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photography  O
,  O
the  O
private  O
beach  O
is  O
still  O
under  O
construction  O
and  O
muddy  O
.  O

The  O
toilet  O
is  O
very  O
spacious  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
half  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
the  O
bedroom  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
bath  O
tub  O
was  O
quite  O
dirty  O
so  O
I  O
never  O
used  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
bedroom  O
is  O
smaller  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
twin  O
beds  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
an  O
in  O
room  O
toilet  O
and  O
tv  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
top  O
floor  O
is  O
the  O
sky  O
terrace  O
.  O

In  O
front  O
is  O
the  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
sea  O
while  O
the  O
back  O
are  O
the  O
hillside  O
villas  O
.  O

The  O
design  O
of  O
Montigo  O
Resorts  O
Nongsa  O
is  O
really  O
nice  O
and  O
the  O
place  O
is  O
beautiful  O
.  O

It  O
does  O
n't  O
feel  O
like  O
I  O
am  O
in  O
Batam  O
at  O
all  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
like  O
I  O
am  O
somewhere  O
in  O
Phuket  O
or  O
Bali  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
basically  O
nothing  O
at  O
Nongsa  O
area  O
and  O
its  O
about  O
an  O
hour  O
drive  O
to  O
Batam  O
City  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
suitable  O
for  O
a  O
nice  O
romantic  O
weekend  O
or  O
getaway  O
from  O
the  O
hustle  O
life  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
also  O
a  O
lot  O
to  O
be  O
desired  O
on  O
their  O
housekeeping  O
and  O
maintenance  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
year  O
old  O
property  O
,  O
the  O
place  O
is  O
considered  O
quite  O
dirty  O
and  O
worn  O
.  O

The  O
private  O
beach  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
ready  O
yet  O
.  O

)  O
is  O
a  O
salad  O
type  O
mixed  O
rice  O
with  O
assorted  O
vegetables  O
and  O
toppings  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
vegetables  O
were  O
more  O
than  O
the  O
rice  O
serving  O
.  O

Definitely  O
a  O
healthier  O
option  O
and  O
for  O
those  O
that  O
wants  O
to  O

Hot  O
Stone  O
Bibimbap  O
4/5  O

The  O
Hot  O
Stone  O
Bibimbap  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
bibimbap  O
set  O
except  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
hot  O
stone  O
bowl  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
hot  O
stone  O
bibimbap  O
to  O
normal  O
bibimbap  O
and  O
bibigo  O
rice  O
because  O
the  O
rice  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
burnt  O
crisp  O
texture  O
.  O

Among  O
all  O
the  O
combination  O
we  O
tried  O
,  O
the  O
black  O
rice  O
is  O
very  O
memorable  O
.  O

It  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
wild  O
rice  O
used  O
in  O
western  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Hoddeok  O
4/5  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
dessert  O
that  O
we  O
seldom  O
get  O
to  O
eat  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Hoddeok  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
Korean  O
sweet  O
pancake  O
served  O
with  O
cinnamon  O
and  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

The  O
warm  O
pancake  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
sweet  O
and  O
chewy  O
texture  O
that  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Bibigo  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
4/5  O

Made  O
from  O
the  O
black  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
Bibigo  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
crispy  O
rice  O
crust  O
which  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O
combination  O
.  O

It  O
added  O
a  O
nice  O
dimension  O
of  O
enjoying  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

Unlike  O
most  O
Korean  O
restaurants  O
that  O
serves  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
complimentary  O
side  O
dishes  O
,  O
Bibigo  O

Nevertheless  O
most  O

with  O

of  O
authentic  O
kimichi  O
,  O
succulent  O

and  O
fresh  O

I  O

a  O

I  O

many  O
as  O
I  O
could  O
smell  O
it  O
from  O
a  O

It  O

that  O
we  O

the  O

up  O
the  O

with  O
a  O
rich  O

of  O

but  O
the  O

slightly  O

Individually  O
the  O

was  O
pretty  O
tantalizing  O

I  O
did  O
go  O
back  O
for  O
more  O

As  O
a  O

just  O
what  O
I  O
needed  O
for  O

I  O
got  O

On  O

Congratulation  O
JohorKaki  O
!  O

As  O
you  O
may  O
know  O
Maureen  O
aka  O
MissTamChiak  O
and  O
me  O
have  O
organised  O
several  O
hawker  O
food  O
trails  O
and  O
foodies  O
gatherings  O
,  O
Tony  O
has  O
also  O
joined  O
us  O
on  O
a  O
few  O
occasions  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
at  O
one  O
of  O
these  O
gatherings  O
we  O
discussed  O
about  O
doing  O
a  O
Johor  O
food  O
trail  O
and  O
finally  O
we  O
put  O
it  O
to  O
plan  O
on  O
11  O
March  O
2013  O
on  O
a  O
Monday  O
morning  O
.  O

After  O
meeting  O
Tony  O
at  O
8am  O
,  O
he  O
drove  O
us  O
into  O
Johor  O
.  O

Traffic  O
was  O
quite  O
smooth  O
since  O
its  O
a  O
Monday  O
morning  O
and  O
within  O
15  O
minutes  O
we  O
were  O
at  O
the  O
other  O
side  O
of  O
the  O
causeway  O
.  O

Our  O
first  O
stop  O
for  O
breakfast  O
was  O
Bukit  O
Chagar  O
Roti  O
Canai  O
.  O

Bukit  O
Chagar  O
Roti  O
Canai  O
has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
24  O
years  O
.  O

It  O
only  O
opens  O
in  O
the  O
morning  O
from  O
6am  O
to  O
11am  O
.  O

Usually  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
sold  O
out  O
by  O
10am  O
so  O
be  O
there  O
early  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
both  O
the  O
plain  O
and  O
egg  O
roti  O
canai  O
a  O
total  O
of5  O
pieces  O
which  O
cost  O
us  O
around  O
$  O
8  O
ringgit  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
plain  O
roti  O
canai  O
over  O
the  O
egg  O
one  O
.  O

The  O
roti  O
canai  O
seems  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
thicker  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
one  O
I  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
but  O
yet  O
fluffy  O
and  O
airy  O
inside  O

The  O

has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O

Tony  O
told  O

I  O
have  O
never  O

such  O

in  O

It  O
felt  O

a  O
combo  O
bowl  O
of  O
seafood  O
plus  O
pig  O

in  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
clear  O

sweet  O
without  O
the  O
trace  O
of  O

being  O
used  O

the  O

Tony  O
has  O
been  O
raving  O
about  O
the  O
famous  O
fried  O
durian  O
fritter  O
so  O
we  O
definitely  O
must  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
try  O
.  O

It  O
seems  O
like  O
Wah  O
Cai  O
has  O
become  O
a  O
little  O
celebrity  O
in  O
Johor  O

being  O
featured  O
in  O

Cai  O
uses  O
a  O

which  O
gave  O
the  O

goodies  O
an  O

I  O
hate  O
to  O
admit  O
it  O
but  O
I  O
am  O
totally  O
sold  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
beyond  O
awesome  O
!  O

Yes  O
I  O
maybe  O
bias  O
since  O
I  O
love  O
durian  O
but  O
for  O
the  O
durian  O
lovers  O
out  O
there  O
you  O
probably  O
will  O
stand  O
by  O
me  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
real  O
thing  O
using  O
premium  O
durians  O
(  O
D24  O
and  O
D101  O
)  O
that  O
is  O
further  O
encased  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
batter  O
deep  O
fried  O
but  O
not  O
stealing  O
the  O
limelight  O
of  O
the  O

giving  O
it  O
a  O
whole  O
new  O
dimension  O
of  O
enjoying  O
the  O
king  O
of  O

we  O

ourselves  O
to  O

the  O

.  O

The  O

It  O

The  O
Wanton  O

here  O

not  O

a  O

for  O
his  O

version  O

It  O
can  O

After  O

The  O

Tony  O
was  O
sharing  O
with  O
us  O
since  O
morning  O
that  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
Kia  O
is  O
a  O
staple  O
dish  O
of  O
Johor  O

.  O

For  O
the  O
whole  O
day  O
he  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
bring  O
us  O

most  O
of  O
them  O
were  O
closed  O

We  O
finally  O

to  O
visit  O
Restoran  O

which  O
is  O
open  O
on  O
Monday  O

For  O
the  O
whole  O
day  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
wondering  O
what  O
is  O
the  O
difference  O
between  O
Kway  O

and  O
Kway  O
Teow  O

at  O
this  O

at  O

(  O

to  O

it  O
out  O
ourselves  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
ordinary  O
.  O

The  O
radish  O
cake  O
was  O
rather  O
mushy  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
eggs  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
which  O
suits  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

Our  O
last  O
stop  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
was  O
at  O

for  O

There  O
were  O
many  O
stalls  O
at  O

but  O
our  O
limited  O
stomach  O
space  O
prevented  O
us  O
from  O
checking  O
them  O
all  O
out  O
.  O

We  O
settled  O
for  O

the  O

,  O
not  O

it  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
named  O
after  O

Tonny  O
himself  O
who  O
comes  O
from  O
Hong  O
Kong  O

cuisine  O
.  O

Hong  O

Dinner  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Wontons  O
with  O
Spicy  O
Sauce  O
.  O

The  O
wantons  O
were  O
as  O
huge  O
as  O
ping  O
pong  O
balls  O
filled  O
with  O
delectable  O
filling  O
with  O
the  O
thin  O
wanton  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
unfortunately  O
lacked  O
the  O
kick  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
.  O

Panfried  O
Dace  O
Fishcake  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Panfried  O
Dace  O
Fishcake  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
with  O
Lup  O
Cheong  O
(  O
Chinese  O
sausage  O
)  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
.  O

A  O
medley  O
of  O
enjoyable  O
textures  O
and  O
flavours  O
coming  O
together  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Yam  O
with  O
Truffle  O
Oil  O
4.5.5  O

There  O
are  O
2  O
signature  O
dishes  O
at  O
Tonny  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

They  O
are  O
Crouching  O
Tiger  O
Hidden  O
Dragon  O
which  O
is  O
lobster  O
puree  O
cooked  O
with  O
egg  O
white  O
and  O
Crispy  O
Yam  O
with  O
Truffle  O
Oil  O
.  O

Although  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
crouching  O
tiger  O
hidden  O
dragon  O
,  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
crispy  O
yam  O
with  O
truffle  O
oil  O
.  O

Knowing  O
Singaporean  O
's  O
love  O
for  O
yam  O
which  O
is  O
usually  O
served  O
mashed  O
or  O
sliced  O
,  O
Chef  O
Tonny  O
innovated  O
and  O
created  O
this  O
crispy  O
and  O
crunchy  O
yam  O
that  O
was  O
cut  O
into  O
threads  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

A  O
special  O
sauce  O
,  O
sesame  O
and  O
truffle  O
oil  O
is  O
added  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
this  O
dish  O
also  O
makes  O
a  O
good  O
Lunar  O
New  O
Year  O
Lo  O
Hei  O
or  O
Yusheng  O
dish  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Prawns  O
3/5  O

The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Prawns  O
was  O
fresh  O
but  O
quite  O
ordinary  O
.  O

Deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
and  O
golden  O
brown  O
,  O
I  O
even  O
ate  O
it  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
shell  O
.  O

Fried  O
Green  O
Wrasse  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
with  O
Crab  O
Roe  O
4/5  O

The  O
Fried  O
Green  O
Wrasse  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
with  O
Crab  O
Roe  O
was  O
another  O
unique  O
combination  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
crab  O
roe  O
sauce  O
that  O
was  O
drenched  O
over  O
the  O
fish  O
fillet  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
highlight  O
for  O
me  O
was  O
the  O
translucent  O
Fen  O
Pi  O
(  O
)  O
or  O
bean  O
flour  O
sheet  O
made  O
from  O
green  O
bean  O
flour  O
.  O

My  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
it  O
was  O
at  O
Hai  O
Siang  O
Joo  O
Seafood  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

Quite  O
similar  O
to  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
but  O
it  O
is  O
translucent  O
and  O
the  O
texture  O
is  O
firmer  O

whole  O

For  O
those  O
that  O
hate  O
to  O
eat  O
eggplant  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
mushy  O
texture  O
may  O
have  O
a  O
second  O
thought  O
as  O
the  O
whole  O
eggplant  O
is  O
stuffed  O
with  O
delectable  O
kurobuta  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
French  O
Beans  O
with  O
Homemade  O

Meat  O
may  O
looked  O
like  O
two  O
different  O
ingredients  O

it  O

The  O
2  O

I  O
could  O
not  O

going  O

more  O

The  O
Claypot  O
Chicken  O
with  O
Chinese  O
Wine  O
was  O
excellently  O
executed  O
.  O

Not  O
overlysophisticatedbut  O
yet  O
bringing  O
out  O
the  O
best  O
of  O
the  O
ingredient  O
,  O
the  O

was  O
tender  O
and  O
nicely  O

Among  O
the  O
diners  O
atmy  O
table  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
some  O
regulars  O
who  O
have  O
eaten  O
at  O
Tonny  O
Restaurant  O
in  O
their  O
previous  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
session  O
told  O
me  O
about  O
the  O
braised  O
duck  O
here  O
hence  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
with  O
Winter  O
Bamboo  O
Shoots  O
indeed  O
was  O
worth  O
the  O
wait  O
for  O
its  O
fragrant  O
and  O
tender  O
meat  O
.  O

Braised  O
Fish  O

4.5/5  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
full  O

and  O
the  O
food  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
slow  O
coming  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
kitchen  O
.  O

Some  O
diners  O
at  O
our  O
table  O
wanted  O
to  O
make  O
a  O
move  O
first  O
but  O
the  O
organizers  O
asked  O
them  O
to  O
stay  O
for  O
the  O
Braised  O
Fish  O
Noodles  O
with  O
Goose  O
Liver  O
Paste  O
.  O

Was  O
it  O
worth  O
staying  O
for  O
the  O
noodles  O
?  O

Yes  O
it  O
was  O
!  O

Made  O
with  O
fish  O
meat  O
and  O
flour  O
,  O
the  O
noodles  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
firm  O
and  O
springy  O
texture  O
that  O
was  O
quite  O
beyond  O
my  O
expectation  O
in  O
a  O
good  O
way  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
sauce  O
for  O
theMushroom  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Noodles  O
Dry  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
was  O
vinegar  O
because  O
of  O
its  O
dark  O
colour  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
special  O
sauce  O
that  O
paired  O
pretty  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
springy  O
noodles  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
is  O
also  O
very  O
generous  O
in  O
the  O
serving  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
slices  O
of  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
lean  O
meat  O
,  O
livers  O
and  O
minced  O
pork  O
in  O

I  O
can  O
already  O
smell  O
the  O
fragrant  O
aroma  O
of  O
Ti  O
Poh  O
(  O
dried  O
sole  O
fish  O
)  O
from  O
the  O

at  O

distance  O
.  O

The  O
Mushroom  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Noodles  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
definitely  O
fare  O
much  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
dry  O
one  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
and  O
most  O
flavoursomebak  O
chor  O
mee  O

I  O
have  O
ever  O
come  O

I  O
even  O

going  O
back  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
definitely  O

It  O
seems  O
like  O
many  O
Japanese  O
restaurants  O
have  O
been  O
venturing  O
overseas  O
opening  O
new  O
outlets  O
in  O
Singapore.A  O
new  O
Japanese  O
Yakiniku  O
(  O
barbeque  O
)  O
restaurant  O
chain  O
,  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
has  O
chosen  O
Mandarin  O
Gallery  O
in  O
Singapore  O
for  O
it  O
's  O
first  O
ever  O
outlet  O
outside  O
Japan  O
.  O

Ito  O
Kacho  O
is  O
established  O
in  O
2009  O
by  O
Sumikin  O
Bussan  O
(  O
a  O
large  O
Japanese  O
corporation  O
)  O
strived  O
to  O
provide  O
top  O
grade  O
barbequed  O
beef  O
at  O
affordable  O
cost  O
.  O

Jakasei  O
Potato  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

While  O
waiting  O
for  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
some  O
small  O
bites  O
to  O
fill  O
our  O
hungry  O
stomach  O
.  O

The  O
Jakasei  O
Potato  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
11.80  O
)  O
was  O
presented  O
like  O
a  O
volcano  O
with  O
the  O
bacon  O
resembling  O
lava  O
flowing  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
erupted  O
potato  O
salad  O
mountain  O
.  O

The  O
potato  O
salad  O
itself  O
is  O
already  O
quite  O
nice  O
with  O
a  O
smooth  O
creamy  O
texture  O
with  O
occasional  O
discovery  O
of  O
bite  O
size  O
eggs  O
,  O
carrots  O
and  O
onions  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
bacon  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
redundant  O
except  O
for  O
decorative  O
purpose  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
crisp  O
.  O

Salmon  O
and  O
Cream  O
Cheese  O
Namaharumaki  O
3.8/5  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
took  O
a  O
second  O
look  O
when  O
the  O
Salmon  O
and  O
Cream  O
Cheese  O
Namaharumaki  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
moment  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
have  O
stepped  O
into  O
a  O
Vietnamese  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
rice  O
paper  O
is  O
used  O
in  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
namaharumaki  O
sure  O
whetted  O
up  O
the  O
appetite  O
for  O
more  O
delicious  O
food  O
to  O
come  O
.  O

Ito  O
Kacho  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
was  O
arefreshing  O
salad  O
consisted  O
of  O
lettuce  O
,  O
onion  O
red  O
and  O
yellow  O
pepper  O
,  O
cherry  O
tomato  O
and  O
fried  O
onion  O
.  O

The  O
healthy  O
greens  O
were  O
brought  O
together  O
nicely  O
by  O
the  O
goma  O
sauce  O
making  O
it  O
a  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
dish  O
.  O

Kimchi  O
Moriawase  O
3.5/5  O

Namuru  O
Moriawase  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
next  O
2  O
dishes  O
got  O
me  O
a  O
bit  O
confused  O
.  O

First  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
was  O
in  O
a  O
Korean  O
barbeque  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Second  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
Kimchi  O
Moriawase  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
and  O
Namuru  O
Moriawase  O
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
was  O
complimentary  O
just  O
like  O
what  O
we  O
will  O
get  O
in  O
a  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
Kimchi  O
Moriawase  O
is  O
a  O
platter  O
of  O
assorted  O
kimchi  O
consisting  O
of  O
cucumber  O
,  O
chinese  O
cabbage  O
and  O
white  O
radish  O
kimchi  O
.  O

The  O
Namuru  O
Moriawase  O
is  O
another  O
platter  O
of  O
vegetables  O
making  O
up  O
of  O
lightly  O
seasoned  O
white  O
radish  O
,  O
bean  O
sprout  O
,  O
cinnamon  O
fern  O
and  O
spinach  O
.  O

The  O
cinnamon  O
fern  O
was  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
diners  O
.  O

Dashimaki  O
Tamago  O
4/5  O

For  O
a  O
different  O
,  O
the  O
Dashimaki  O
Tamago  O
(  O
$  O
6.80  O
)  O
at  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
sweet  O
compared  O
to  O
other  O
Japan  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
prefer  O
the  O
version  O
served  O
at  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
because  O
it  O
has  O
a  O
more  O
natural  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Wagyu  O
Tongue  O
4/5  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
adventurous  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
Wagyu  O
Tongue  O
(  O
80gram  O
for  O
$  O
29  O
,  O
120gram  O
for  O
$  O
39  O
)  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
the  O
diners  O
in  O
the  O
group  O
were  O
game  O
to  O
it  O
so  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
have  O
more  O
.  O

Lightly  O
seasoned  O
with  O
just  O
pepper  O
and  O
salt  O
,  O
the  O
wagyu  O
tongue  O
needs  O
only  O
30  O
seconds  O
on  O
the  O
grill  O
to  O
be  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O
wagyu  O
tongue  O
actually  O
taste  O
quite  O
nice  O
with  O
its  O
nice  O
marbling  O
.  O

The  O
texture  O
was  O
rather  O
bouncy  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
scallop  O
.  O

Premium  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
starat  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
their  O
premium  O
wagyu  O

.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O

.  O

Ito  O
Kacho  O
imports  O
these  O
beautiful  O
marbled  O
meat  O
solely  O
from  O
Kyushu  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
first  O
Yakiniku  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Japan  O
to  O
use  O
chilled  O
meat  O
instead  O
of  O
frozen  O
meat  O
to  O
retain  O
the  O
marbling  O
and  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
better  O
overall  O
consistency  O

Pork  O
Collar  O
4.5/5  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
pork  O
is  O
the  O
Tsubo-Zuke-Kurobuta  O
(  O
pork  O
collar  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O
jar  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
the  O
pork  O
collar  O
was  O
marinated  O
overnight  O
everyday  O
,  O
no  O
wonder  O
it  O
was  O
so  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
the  O
convection  O
system  O
is  O
built  O
into  O
the  O
barbeque  O
pit  O
sucking  O
out  O
any  O
air  O
that  O
rises  O
above  O
the  O
cooking  O
food  O

ensuring  O
patron  O
does  O
not  O
leave  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
seafood  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Oo-Ebi  O
Yaki  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
,  O
Ika  O
Yaki  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
)  O
and  O
Hotate  O
Yaki  O
(  O
$  O
19.8  O
)  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
Oo-Ebi  O
Yaki  O
which  O
is  O
Giant  O
Tiger  O
Prawns  O
for  O
grill  O
,  O
these  O
prawns  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

The  O
squids  O
and  O
Hokkaido  O
scallops  O
were  O
cooked  O
in  O
aluminum  O
tray  O
over  O
the  O
grill  O
together  O
with  O
some  O
marinade  O
.  O

The  O
squid  O
and  O
scallops  O
were  O
fresh  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
seasoning  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
mild  O
side  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
expecting  O
something  O
stronger  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

King  O

Yaki  O

The  O
King  O
Crab  O
Yaki  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
)  O
was  O
huge  O
and  O
meaty  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
so  O
beautiful  O
that  O
we  O
ate  O
it  O
cold  O
without  O
grilling  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
that  O
like  O
fried  O
stuff  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
tried  O
the  O
King  O
Crab  O
Tempura  O
(  O
$  O
26  O
)  O
.  O

Lightly  O
battered  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O
,  O
its  O
another  O
way  O
of  O
enjoying  O
this  O
lovely  O
seafood  O
.  O

Spider  O
Roll  O
4/5  O

I  O
was  O
wondering  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
Spider  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
when  O
Melissa  O
ordered  O
it  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
actually  O
Soft  O
Shell  O
Crab  O
Sushi  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
term  O
spider  O
probably  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
legs  O
of  O
the  O
soft  O
shell  O
crab  O
sticking  O
outfrom  O
the  O
roll  O
.  O

Ishiyaki  O
Sundubu  O
Chige  O
4/5  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
not  O
into  O
Yakiniku  O
,  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
also  O
offers  O
a  O
slate  O
of  O
other  O
tradition  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
Ishiyaki  O
Sundubu  O
Chige  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
either  O
beef  O
or  O
clam  O
soup  O
base  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
piping  O
hot  O
spicy  O
soup  O
served  O
in  O
sizzling  O
stone  O
bowl  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
find  O
tofu  O
,  O
clams  O
,  O
and  O
mushrooms  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
soup  O
just  O
nice  O
for  O
the  O
cold  O
weather  O
.  O

Ishiyaki  O
Bibimbap  O
4/5  O

The  O
Ishiyaki  O
Bibimbap  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
can  O
serve  O
2  O
pax  O
too  O
.  O

Not  O
too  O
sure  O
what  O
the  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
of  O
but  O
it  O
beautifully  O
brought  O
the  O
dish  O
together  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
crispy  O
burnt  O
bits  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
of  O
the  O
sizzling  O
hot  O
stone  O
bowl  O
,  O
giving  O
the  O
dish  O
an  O
extra  O
texture  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
I  O
am  O
confused  O
by  O
the  O
food  O
served  O
at  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
meats  O
and  O
seafood  O
for  O
grill  O
,  O
the  O
menu  O
includes  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
.  O

So  O
is  O
this  O
a  O
Japanese  O
or  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
?  O

For  O
some  O
,  O
this  O
may  O
be  O
great  O
as  O
one  O
can  O
have  O
choices  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
does  O
offer  O
top  O
grade  O
meats  O
for  O
the  O
barbeque  O
at  O
a  O
reasonable  O
rate  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
definitely  O
a  O
place  O
to  O
consider  O
if  O
one  O
is  O
craving  O
for  O
barbeque  O
.  O

Rotisserie  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

The  O
last  O
time  O
I  O
visit  O
Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
was  O
probably  O
more  O
than  O
ten  O
years  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Suntec  O
City  O
branch  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
remember  O
back  O
then  O
itwas  O
self  O
service  O
,  O
one  O
needed  O
to  O
order  O
and  O
pay  O
at  O
the  O
counter  O
before  O
proceeding  O
down  O
the  O
line  O
to  O
collect  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

Service  O
has  O
since  O
changed  O
.  O

Your  O
order  O
is  O
now  O
taken  O
by  O
the  O
waiter/waitress  O
and  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
being  O
served  O
to  O
you  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Lucille  O
(  O
$  O
41.90  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
half  O
rotisserie  O
chicken  O
,  O
half  O
slab  O
of  O
honey  O
bourbon  O
ribs  O
and  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
3  O
regular  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
Rotisserie  O
Chicken  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
better  O
some  O
restaurants  O
I  O
have  O
tried  O
.  O

The  O
rotisserie  O
chicken  O
was  O
roasted  O
to  O
perfection  O
,  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
juicy  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

Honey  O
Bourbon  O
Ribs  O
4/5  O

The  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
Honey  O
Bourbon  O
Ribs  O
was  O
simply  O
finger  O
licking  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
tender  O
meat  O
with  O
the  O
beautiful  O
sauce  O
worked  O
in  O
harmony  O
for  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
better  O
ribs  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
.  O

Potato  O

Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
has  O
14  O
different  O
sides  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
categorized  O
under  O
hot  O
and  O
cold  O
sides  O
.  O

For  O
our  O
choices  O
of  O
3  O
sides  O
,  O
we  O
opted  O
for  O
the  O
Potato  O
Salad  O
,  O
Macaroni  O
&  O
Cheese  O
and  O
Coleslaw  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
three  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
macaroni  O
&  O
cheese  O
.  O

Not  O
because  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
best  O
but  O
the  O
potato  O
saladwas  O
over  O
dressed  O
with  O
mayonnaise  O
while  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
enjoy  O
the  O
onions  O

the  O

.  O

Corn  O

Besides  O
the  O
signature  O

chicken  O
at  O
Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
,  O
the  O
other  O
memory  O
I  O
have  O
is  O
the  O
Corn  O
Muffin  O
.  O

Upon  O
taking  O
our  O
orders  O
,  O
complimentary  O
corn  O
muffin  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
did  O
n't  O
disappoint  O
me  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
before  O
.  O

Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
20  O
years  O

it  O

food  O
to  O

greasy  O
ramen  O
broth  O
so  O
I  O
opt  O
for  O
the  O
Shoyu  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
13.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
may  O
look  O
simple  O
yet  O
each  O
sip  O
of  O
the  O
fragrant  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
was  O
truly  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
broth  O
,  O
the  O
other  O
highlight  O
at  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
is  O
their  O
wheat  O
flour  O
noodles  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
is  O
thicker  O
with  O
a  O
firmer  O
and  O
springier  O
texture  O
.  O

Miso  O
Uma  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Miso  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
only  O
diced  O
flamed  O
charshu  O
and  O
corns  O
seem  O
rather  O
expensive  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
ramen  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
thick  O
cut  O
flamed  O
charshu  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
miso  O
broth  O
but  O
it  O
justgave  O
the  O
feeling  O
ofbeing  O
short  O
changed  O
with  O
the  O
pricing  O
.  O

Kara  O
Uma  O
3.5/5  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
most  O
spicy  O
Kara  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
tried  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
spicier  O
than  O
what  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
Japan  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
and  O
love  O
for  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Aji  O
Tama  O
Uma  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
hot  O
seller  O
at  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
is  O
the  O
Aji  O
Tama  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
really  O
very  O
rich  O
and  O
robust  O
but  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
give  O
the  O
feeling  O
of  O
being  O
too  O
complex  O
in  O
flavours  O
.  O

For  O
just  O
a  O
mere  O
$  O
15  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
with  O
its  O
rich  O
flavours  O
,  O
thick  O
cut  O
flamed  O
pork  O
belly  O
and  O
ajitama  O
.  O

My  O
only  O
concern  O
is  O
the  O
layer  O
of  O
artery  O
clogging  O
oilfloating  O
onthe  O
surface  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
when  O
itwas  O
left  O
to  O
cool  O
.  O

Gyoza  O
3/5  O

Besides  O
the  O
ramen  O
,  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
also  O
offers  O
a  O
few  O
side  O
dishes  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
Gyoza  O
(  O
5pc  O
for  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

The  O
thin  O
gyoza  O
skin  O
was  O
pan  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
but  O
the  O
filling  O
was  O
rather  O
unnoticeable  O
and  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

Aburi  O
Charshu  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
other  O
star  O
of  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
Aburi  O
Charshu  O
(  O
$  O
9  O
)  O
.  O

Thethick  O
slices  O
of  O
charshu  O
were  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
that  O
simply  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
we  O
ordered  O
another  O
plate  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Yakitori  O
Combo  O
3/5  O

The  O
Yakitori  O
Combo  O
(  O
5  O
sticks  O
at  O
$  O
14.80  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
Tori-niku  O
(  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
)  O
,  O
Negima  O
(  O

,  O
Butabara  O
(  O

,  O
Sasmi  O
(  O

)  O
and  O
Sunazuri  O
(  O
gizzards  O
)  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
5  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
butabara  O
.  O

Bari  O
Uma  O
maybe  O
the  O
new  O
kid  O
on  O
the  O
block  O
but  O
its  O
ramen  O
has  O
already  O
received  O
many  O
good  O
reviews  O
and  O
I  O
concurred  O
that  O
after  O
trying  O
out  O
their  O
ramen  O
.  O

Just  O
like  O
their  O
sloganSaikyo  O
Nokou  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
broth  O
is  O
indeed  O
very  O
rich  O
,  O
mellow  O
and  O
smooth  O
.  O

The  O
excellent  O
bowl  O
of  O
richness  O
should  O
be  O
proud  O
of  O
themselves  O
standing  O
tall  O
among  O
the  O
competitions  O
in  O
the  O
ramen  O
scene  O

The  O

at  O

The  O
prawn  O

rather  O
expensive  O
.  O

It  O
ranges  O
from  O
$  O

to  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
remember  O
what  O

the  O

Pork  O
Ribs  O
and  O
Prawn  O
Mee  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
mirky  O

was  O
packed  O
with  O
rich  O
robust  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
prawn  O

Street  O

at  O
Bay  O

is  O
actually  O
the  O
former  O
Rumah  O
Rasa  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
since  O
been  O
revamped  O
dropping  O
their  O
halal  O
Indonesian  O
cuisine  O
concept  O
and  O
introducing  O
global  O
flavours  O
to  O
cater  O
for  O

wider  O
audience  O

Losing  O
focus  O
for  O
a  O
restaurant  O
?  O

Well  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
hotel  O
restaurant  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
understand  O
the  O
need  O
to  O
offer  O
diverse  O
flavours  O
to  O
both  O
visitors  O
and  O
Singaporeans  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Duck  O
and  O
Citrus  O
Fruits  O
3/5  O

The  O
Smoked  O
Duck  O
and  O
Citrus  O
Fruits  O
(  O
$  O
11  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
starter  O
to  O
whet  O
up  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
is  O
cooked  O
beautiful  O
,  O
tossed  O
in  O
orange  O
vincotto  O
dressing  O
with  O
orange  O
,  O
grapefruit  O
,  O
roasted  O
walnut  O
and  O
endive  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
citrus  O
vincotto  O
dressing  O
would  O
be  O
perfect  O
.  O

Caprese  O
3/5  O

The  O
Caprese  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointing  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
selection  O
of  O
interspersed  O
vineyard  O
tomatoes  O
were  O
beautifully  O
sweet  O
,  O
the  O
buffalo  O
mozzarella  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
dry  O
and  O
firm  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
those  O
that  O
is  O
served  O
moist  O
and  O
creamy  O
.  O

Hazelnut  O
Escargot  O

The  O
Burgundy  O

were  O
stuffed  O
with  O

then  O

Ok  O
this  O
is  O
something  O
really  O
interesting  O

When  O
was  O
the  O
last  O
time  O
youseen  O
a  O
hotel  O
restaurant  O
serving  O

on  O
their  O

I  O

there  O
was  O
any  O

There  O
are  O
3  O

with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
either  O
Tom  O

Salmon  O
Cutlet  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Salmon  O
Cutlet  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
was  O
nicely  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
skin  O
while  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
still  O
pinkish  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

The  O
menu  O
said  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
aligot  O
potatoes  O
.  O

Aligot  O
supposes  O
to  O
be  O
fondue  O
form  O
to  O
my  O
humble  O
understanding  O
but  O
what  O
is  O
served  O
was  O
rather  O
mashymash  O
potatoes  O
.  O

My  O
first  O
encounter  O
of  O
wild  O
rice  O
was  O
at  O

kitchen  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture.The  O
Roulade  O
of  O
Porkloin  O
Stuffed  O
with  O
Wild  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O

was  O
done  O
pretty  O
well  O

Duck  O
Pot  O
Pie  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Duck  O
Pot  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
welcome  O
twist  O
to  O
the  O
usually  O
beef  O
that  O
is  O
used  O
for  O
the  O
puff  O
pastry  O
.  O

A  O
rich  O

Orient  O

3.8/5  O

Another  O
fusion  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
the  O
Orient  O
Barbecue  O
Pizza  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
thin  O
crust  O
pizza  O
came  O
with  O
smoked  O
duck  O
,  O
enoki  O
mushroom  O
,  O
spring  O
onions  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
toppings  O
with  O
hoison  O
sauce  O
.  O

A  O
good  O
twist  O
to  O
the  O
norm  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
pizza  O
to  O
be  O
cheesy  O
rather  O
than  O
the  O
sweet  O
hoison  O
sauce  O
.  O

Lamb  O
Redang  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
star  O
and  O
highlight  O
at  O
Street  O
50  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
Lamb  O
Redang  O
(  O
$  O
24  O
)  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
signature  O
and  O
memorable  O
dish  O
of  O
the  O
old  O
Rumah  O
Rasa  O
and  O
the  O
new  O

coming  O
together  O
in  O
a  O

down  O
the  O

a  O
scenic  O
sea  O
view.Kids  O
can  O
also  O
be  O

The  O

Being  O
a  O
family  O

restaurant  O
,  O
it  O

is  O

Although  O
the  O
buffet  O
selection  O
is  O
not  O
as  O
extensive  O
compared  O
to  O
others  O
,  O
it  O
definitely  O
made  O
up  O
for  O
it  O
with  O
its  O
quality  O
.  O

My  O
lunch  O
began  O
with  O
some  O
amuse  O

.  O

The  O
oyster  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
fleshy.It  O
was  O
briny  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

Given  O
a  O
choice  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
oyster  O
to  O
be  O
creamy  O
and  O
fatter  O
.  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
cooked  O
food  O

,  O
I  O

it  O
was  O

,  O
Barnacles  O
specially  O
prepared  O
the  O

The  O
result  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyable  O
traditional  O

The  O
venue  O
for  O
January  O
2013  O
Makansutra  O
dinner  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
at  O
Aljunied  O
which  O
was  O
opened  O
in  O
November  O
2011  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
heard  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
until  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
after  O
some  O
research  O
and  O
chatting  O
with  O
my  O
dinner  O
mates  O
did  O
I  O
realise  O
the  O
owner  O
behind  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
is  O
the  O
same  O
owner  O
for  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O
at  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
visited  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O
on  O
a  O
few  O
occasions  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
there  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
their  O
new  O
fine  O
oriental  O
dining  O
concept  O
at  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
.  O

From  O
a  O
shop  O
house  O
in  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
,  O
Yummy  O
Holdings  O
expands  O
into  O
a  O
full  O
fledged  O
restaurant  O
with  O
its  O
bold  O
and  O
elegant  O
decor  O
that  O
emphasises  O
on  O
antique  O
and  O
chinese  O
culture  O
.  O

The  O
hundred  O
years  O
old  O
elm  O
main  O
door  O
welcomes  O
you  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
with  O
its  O
wooden  O
floorboards  O
that  O
are  O
made  O
from  O
century  O
old  O
recycle  O
planks  O
of  O
railway  O
sleepers  O
which  O
are  O
quality  O
hardwood  O
that  O
are  O
still  O
in  O
a  O
perfect  O
condition  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant'sfurnitureare  O
also  O
made  O
of  O
yellow  O
rosewood  O
while  O
the  O
beams  O
supporting  O
the  O
roof  O
are  O
made  O
of  O
durian  O
timber  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
solid  O
and  O
light  O
hardwood  O
.  O

Walking  O
into  O
the  O
entrance  O
,  O
one  O
is  O
greeted  O
by  O
the  O
9  O
statues  O
of  O
the  O
``  O
Dragon  O
's  O
Nine  O
Descendants  O
''  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
a  O
popular  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
legend  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
said  O
that  O
a  O
dragon  O
once  O
gave  O
birth  O
to  O
nine  O
descendants  O
.  O

Prosperous  O
Salmon  O
Yu  O
Sheng  O
3/5  O

In  O
conjunction  O
with  O
Chinese  O
New  O
Year  O
which  O
was  O
just  O
around  O
the  O
corner  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Yu  O
Sheng  O
to  O
usher  O
in  O
the  O
Year  O
of  O
the  O
Snake  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
makansutra  O
regulars  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
tradition  O
every  O
year  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Garlic  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Garlic  O
was  O
nothing  O
special  O
but  O
showcased  O
the  O
freshness  O
and  O
how  O
the  O
used  O
simple  O
ingredients  O
can  O
lift  O
a  O
dish  O
to  O
a  O
new  O
dimension  O
.  O

Double  O
Prosperity  O
Baby  O
Kailan  O
3/5  O

The  O
Baby  O
Kailan  O
done  O
2  O
ways  O
was  O
interesting  O
especially  O
but  O
not  O
fantastic  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
Kailan  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crunch  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
bland  O
and  O
bitter  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
stir  O
fried  O
baby  O
kailan  O
.  O

Yummy  O
Imperial  O
Chicken  O
3/5  O

The  O
Yummy  O
Imperial  O
Chicken  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
garlic  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
for  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

Braised  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
with  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
3.8/5  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
Braised  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
with  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
.  O

At  O
least  O
for  O
me  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
such  O
combination  O
being  O
served  O
in  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
sea  O
cucumber  O
and  O
pork  O
knuckle  O
were  O
cooked  O
until  O
fork  O
tender  O
that  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

Special  O
Butter  O
Bun  O
3/5  O

The  O
Special  O
Butter  O
Bun  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
same  O
as  O
steamed  O
custard  O
bun  O
.  O

The  O
lava  O
filling  O
was  O
delish  O
but  O
the  O
skin  O
of  O
the  O
bun  O
was  O
rather  O
dry  O
and  O
a  O
tad  O
thick  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
had  O
the  O
following  O
dishes  O
Chicken  O
in  O
Pig  O
Stomach  O
Soup  O
,  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
with  O
Wat  O
Meat  O
and  O
Homemade  O
Dou  O
Hua  O
which  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
take  O
any  O
photos  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
is  O
still  O
short  O
of  O
being  O
a  O
full  O
fledged  O
restaurant  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
nice  O
but  O
needs  O
to  O
raise  O
their  O
standard  O
from  O
the  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O
's  O
menu  O

One  O
will  O
not  O
miss  O
the  O
blue  O
and  O
white  O
theme  O
decor  O
of  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
located  O
along  O
Bukit  O
Timah  O
Road  O
.  O

The  O
Greek  O
Restaurant  O
opened  O
by  O
couple  O
Effie  O
and  O
Dennis  O
Tsakiris  O
created  O
a  O
warmmediterranean  O
sea  O
settingin  O
a  O
fourth  O
storey  O
building  O
,  O
born  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
founder  O
's  O
love  O
of  O
sharing  O
a  O
hearty  O
with  O
friends  O
.  O

Serving  O
Greek  O
cuisine  O
,  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
cooked  O
using  O
their  O
own  O
family  O
brand  O
of  O
extra  O
virgin  O
olive  O
oil  O
called  O
Green  O
Gold  O
which  O
can  O
also  O
be  O
purchased  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
understand  O
that  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
serves  O
authentic  O
Greek  O
food  O
that  O
has  O
not  O
been  O
adjusted  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
palates  O
.  O

Pita  O
Bread  O
and  O
Dips  O
4/5  O

The  O
lunch  O
started  O
off  O
withPita  O
Bread  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
with  O
sea  O
salt  O
and  O
paprika  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
pita  O
bred  O
is  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
fluffy  O
inside  O
.  O

Pair  O
with  O
delectable  O
dips  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
starter  O
tantalising  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
dips  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Fava  O
(  O
$  O
11.80  O
)  O
,  O
Taramosalata  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
and  O
Melitzanosalata  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
Fava  O
is  O
yellow  O
lentils  O
with  O
fresh  O
onion  O
,  O
oregano  O
and  O
extra  O
virgin  O
olive  O
oil  O
.  O

Taramosalata  O
iscod  O
roe  O
dip  O
and  O
Melitzanosalata  O
is  O
smoked  O
eggplant  O
mixed  O
with  O
herbs  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
make  O
up  O
my  O
mind  O
which  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
as  O
all  O
of  O
them  O
were  O
as  O
good  O
having  O
their  O
own  O
distinct  O
flavour  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Feta  O
3/5  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
the  O
whole  O
slice  O
of  O
Grilled  O
Feta  O
Cheese  O
(  O
$  O
12.80  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
an  O
expert  O
in  O
cheese  O
appreciation  O
but  O
the  O
feta  O
cheese  O
is  O
usually  O
a  O
bit  O
moist  O
,  O
salty  O
and  O
milky  O
.  O

After  O
being  O
grilled  O
,  O
it  O
lost  O
its  O
saltiness  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
milky  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
firmer  O
and  O
more  O
enjoyable  O
texture  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Spanakopita  O
4.2/5  O

Love  O
the  O
Spanakopita  O
(  O
$  O
12.30  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
phylo  O
pastry  O
filled  O
with  O
spinach  O
,  O
feta  O
cheese  O
and  O
herbs  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
spinach  O
and  O
cheesy  O
stuff  O
hence  O
the  O
filling  O
was  O
a  O
winning  O
combination  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
paper  O
thin  O
pastry  O
was  O
also  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
that  O
was  O
both  O
crispy  O
and  O
flaky  O
.  O

balls  O
,  O
kalamaki  O
,  O
bifteki  O
(  O
beef  O
patty  O
)  O
and  O
lamb  O
chops  O
.  O

Except  O
for  O
the  O
lamb  O
chops  O
which  O
was  O
really  O
flavoursome  O
and  O
succulent  O
,  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
platter  O
was  O
rather  O
toughor  O
dry  O
.  O

Psari  O
Stin  O
Sxara  O
4.2/5  O

From  O
the  O
grill  O
again  O
,  O
the  O
Psari  O
Stin  O
Sxara  O
or  O
Greek  O
Grilled  O
Fish  O
(  O

$  O
39.80  O
,  O
Sea  O

was  O
excellent  O
.  O

Nicely  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
smokey  O
flavour  O
,  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Mousaka  O
4.2/5  O

Our  O
group  O
was  O
already  O
done  O
with  O
our  O
lunch  O
but  O
we  O
ca  O
n't  O
help  O
ordering  O
the  O
Mousaka  O
(  O
$  O
24.80  O
)  O
because  O
it  O
smelled  O
so  O
good  O
from  O
the  O
table  O
beside  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
traditional  O
Greek  O
dish  O
of  O
oven  O
baked  O
eggplant  O
with  O
potatoes  O
,  O
minced  O
meat  O
and  O
bechamel  O
sauce  O
was  O
really  O
hearty  O
and  O
comforting  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
decor  O
of  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
.  O

The  O
relax  O
and  O
casual  O
ambience  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
made  O
one  O
felt  O
like  O
being  O
transported  O
to  O
Greek  O
or  O
the  O
Mediterranean  O
Sea  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
who  O
drives  O
,  O
not  O
to  O
worry  O
as  O
the  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
complimentary  O

My  O
job  O
requires  O
me  O
to  O
travel  O
quite  O
often  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
craved  O
for  O
our  O
local  O
food  O
whenever  O
I  O
am  O
back  O
home  O
.  O

So  O
I  O
would  O
usually  O
head  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
nearest  O
food  O
centre  O
or  O
coffeeshop  O
to  O
satisfy  O
my  O
craving  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
local  O
food  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
or  O
Char  O
Kway  O
Teow  O

For  O
a  O
simpleplate  O
of  O
Fried  O
Kway  O

are  O
many  O

In  O
short  O
there  O
is  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
which  O
is  O
lighter  O
in  O
taste  O
while  O
the  O
local  O
version  O
is  O
sweeter  O
using  O
the  O
sweet  O
dark  O
sauce  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
local  O
style  O
comes  O
in  O
wet  O
or  O
dry  O
version  O
.  O

My  O
preference  O
is  O
the  O
wet  O
version  O
.  O

Fried  O

Besides  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
stall  O
which  O
is  O
conveniently  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
coffeshop  O
just  O
next  O
block  O
where  O
I  O
am  O
staying  O
,  O
my  O
current  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
at  O
Zion  O
Riverside  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Each  O
batch  O
is  O
freshly  O
cooked  O
upon  O
order  O
hence  O
be  O
patient  O
with  O
the  O
long  O
queue  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
here  O
because  O
the  O
wetness  O
of  O
the  O
noodles  O
were  O
just  O
right  O
not  O
overly  O
done  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
it  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
cockles  O
,  O
slices  O
of  O
fish  O

the  O

brough  O
in  O
more  O

It  O
seems  O
like  O
it  O
is  O
arequisite  O
to  O
draw  O
the  O
crowd  O
to  O
the  O
mall  O
.  O

Well  O
saying  O
that  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
really  O
not  O
many  O
things  O
interesting  O
to  O
do  O
in  O
Singapore  O
except  O
shop  O
,  O
eat  O
and  O
movie  O
so  O
why  O
not  O
just  O
house  O
them  O
under  O
one  O
roof  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
exactly  O
the  O
reason  O
why  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Plaza  O
Singapura  O
.  O

To  O
shop  O
,  O
catch  O
a  O
movie  O
and  O
have  O
dinner  O
.  O

Glass  O

After  O
checking  O
out  O
all  O
the  O
new  O
food  O
establishments  O
at  O
Plaza  O
Singapura  O
's  O
new  O
wing  O
,  O
wedecided  O
to  O
try  O
Bangkok  O
Jam  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
less  O
crowded  O
since  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
movie  O
to  O
catch  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
a  O
Glass  O
Noodle  O
Seafood  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
to  O
kick  O
start  O
the  O
meal  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
come  O
with  O
fresh  O
huge  O
prawns  O
but  O
we  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
spicy  O
kick  O
.  O

Tom  O
Yum  O
Seafood  O
Noodle  O
3/5  O

For  O
the  O
main  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
ordered  O
the  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Seafood  O
Noodle  O
(  O
$  O
11.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
was  O
quite  O
springy  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

Minced  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Basil  O
3/5  O

For  O
myself  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Minced  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Basil  O
(  O
$  O
11.90  O
)  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
fried  O
egg  O
and  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
diced  O
long  O
beans  O
thatwas  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
minced  O
chicken  O
,  O
givinga  O
nice  O
crunch  O
to  O
the  O
dish.The  O
minched  O
chicken  O
and  O
basil  O
was  O
rather  O
average  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
strong  O
distinct  O

flavours  O
that  O
will  O
get  O

Are  O
you  O
a  O
pancake  O
lover  O
?  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
,  O
you  O
will  O
be  O
glad  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
pancake  O
specialty  O
full  O

at  O
City  O
Square  O
Mall  O
offering  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
pancakes  O
fromaround  O
the  O
world  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
pancakes  O
such  O
as  O
Pannekoeks  O
,  O
Galettes  O
,  O
American  O
Stacks  O
,  O

Paddington  O
House  O
of  O

serves  O
both  O
savoury  O
and  O
sweet  O
pancakes  O
.  O

One  O
can  O
indulge  O
in  O
a  O
hearty  O
meal  O
or  O
a  O
sweet  O
sinful  O
dessert  O
any  O
time  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
.  O

Lucerne  O
4/5  O

Galette  O
is  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
pancake  O
well  O
known  O
in  O
Brittany  O
,  O
North  O
West  O
of  O
France  O
made  O
from  O
organic  O
buckwheat  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Lucerne  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
served  O
like  O
a  O
pizza  O
with  O
mixed  O
seafood  O
,  O
creamy  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
on  O
top  O
a  O
thin  O
largegalette  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
pancake  O
is  O
rather  O
thin  O
,  O
this  O
need  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
quickly  O
if  O
not  O
the  O
pancake  O
will  O
become  O
soggy  O
.  O

Since  O
this  O
is  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
like  O
a  O
pizza  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
shell  O
of  O
the  O
mussel  O
and  O
tail  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
prawns  O
to  O
be  O
removed  O
.  O

Alaska  O
4/5  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
looking  O
for  O
a  O
full  O
meal  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
their  O
savoury  O
pancake  O
meals  O
served  O
with  O
double  O
'XL  O
'  O
Flapjacks  O
.  O

Flapjack  O
is  O
a  O
kind  O
of  O
thick  O
small  O
pancake  O
usually  O
around  O
10cm  O
in  O
diameter  O
.  O

The  O
Alaska  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
spicy  O
mashed  O
potato  O
pancakes  O
with  O
deep  O
fried  O
bread  O
crumbled  O
dory  O
and  O
creamy  O
mushroom  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
spicy  O
mashed  O
potato  O
pancakes  O
was  O
quite  O
interesting  O
because  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
our  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
the  O
locals  O
will  O
like  O
this  O
.  O

Paddington  O
House  O
of  O
Pancakes  O
does  O
not  O
focus  O
on  O
their  O
pancakes  O
only  O
.  O

Their  O
savoury  O
is  O
not  O
lacklustre  O
.  O

The  O
bread  O
crumbled  O
dory  O
was  O
deep  O
fried  O
toa  O
beautiful  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

Crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

Oslo  O
3.8/5  O

Another  O
flapjack  O
savoury  O
meal  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
Oslo  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
.  O

Comes  O
with  O
pinkish  O
smoked  O
salmon  O
and  O
cheesy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
with  O
grilled  O
zucchini  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
another  O
delightfully  O
hearty  O
meal  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
runny  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Dijon  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
savoury  O
pancakes  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
goes  O
to  O
Dijon  O
(  O
$  O
21  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
crepes  O
with  O
grilled  O
lamb  O
shoulders  O
with  O
peach  O
,  O
plum  O
and  O
passionfruit  O
mustard  O
dressing  O
.  O

The  O
hint  O
of  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
from  O
the  O
dressing  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
lamb  O
shoulder  O
won  O
my  O
heart  O
.  O

In  O
my  O
opinion  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
tissue  O
thin  O
crepe  O
complements  O
the  O
savoury  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
fluffy  O
thick  O
pancake  O
.  O

I  O
agreed  O
the  O
lamb  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O

All  O
Paddington  O

of  O
Pancakes  O
'  O
sundaes  O
are  O
uniquely  O
served  O
with  O
dollar  O
pancakes  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
to  O
call  O
them  O
mini  O
pancakes  O
.  O

Its  O
kind  O
of  O
like  O
having  O
waffles  O
with  O

Chocolate  O
Roll  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
Sweet  O
Pannekoek  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Chocolate  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
with  O
peanut  O
butter  O
,  O
ice  O
cream  O
,  O
Oreo  O
crumbs  O
,  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
,  O
nuts  O
and  O
whipped  O
cream  O
.  O

Pannekoek  O
is  O
a  O
Dutch/Belgian  O
pancake  O
that  O
is  O
usually  O
larger  O
and  O
much  O
thinner  O
than  O
American  O
or  O
Scottish  O
pancakes  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
roll  O
pannekoek  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
local  O
snack  O
,  O

Bombon  O
Dollars  O

For  O
the  O
Dollar  O
Pancakes  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Bombon  O
Dollars  O
(  O

Served  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O

.  O

It  O
feltlike  O
a  O
breakfast  O
bowl  O
.  O

We  O
thought  O
the  O
Bombon  O
Dollars  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
dry  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
until  O
we  O
realized  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
pour  O
the  O
condensed  O
milk  O
into  O
the  O
bowl  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Chips  O
Pancake  O

We  O
also  O
tried  O
the  O
Chocolate  O

Pancake  O
(  O

)  O
that  O
is  O

a  O
scoop  O
of  O
ice  O
cream  O
,  O
marshmallows  O
,  O
nuts  O
and  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
American  O
pancake  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
golden  O
ring  O
around  O
the  O
edge  O
with  O
a  O
crisp  O
while  O
the  O
middle  O
was  O
fluffy  O
.  O

The  O
Pancakes  O
at  O
Paddington  O
are  O
prepared  O
freshly  O
daily  O
at  O
the  O
outlet  O
.  O

A  O
little  O
patient  O
is  O
needed  O
as  O
the  O
pancakes  O
are  O
flipped  O
upon  O
order  O
and  O
served  O
right  O
from  O
the  O
pan  O
to  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

Paddington  O
really  O
has  O
an  O
extensive  O
varieties  O
of  O
pancakes  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O

what  O
to  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Botanic  O
Garden  O
but  O
the  O
thought  O
of  O
the  O
inaccessibility  O
always  O
put  O
me  O
off  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
heard  O
that  O
Halia  O
has  O
opened  O
a  O
new  O
restaurant  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Hotel  O
Singapore  O
,  O
I  O
jumped  O
on  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
establishment  O
.  O

A  O
highlight  O
of  O
The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Hotel  O
is  O
its  O
al  O
fresco  O
bar  O
that  O
serve  O
handcrafted  O
artisanal  O
beverage  O
products  O
around  O
the  O
world  O
.  O

The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Place  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
defunct  O
Seah  O
Street  O
Deli  O
.  O

Position  O
as  O
an  O
urban  O
casual  O
restaurant  O
,  O
serving  O
contemporary  O
European  O
cuisine  O
with  O
Asian  O
touches  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
removed  O
the  O
usual  O
appetiser  O
and  O
mains  O
from  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Instead  O
it  O
introduces  O
an  O
unique  O
concept  O
of  O
small  O
plates  O
and  O
big  O
plates  O
to  O
encourage  O
communal  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
customising  O
your  O
own  O
degustation  O
in  O
a  O
fun  O
and  O
flexible  O
manner  O
.  O

Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

From  O
the  O
small  O
plates  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
,  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
,  O
Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
,  O
Confit  O
Salmon  O
and  O
Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
us  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
our  O
greens  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
bitterness  O
.  O

The  O
apricot  O
chutney  O
and  O
blueberry  O
of  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
23  O
)  O
masked  O
off  O
that  O
unpleasant  O
taste  O
,  O
giving  O
the  O
greens  O
a  O
nice  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
sweetness  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
overwhelming  O
towards  O
the  O
end  O
when  O
the  O
greens  O
got  O
lesser  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
4.2/5  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
salad  O
small  O
plate  O
,  O
The  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
was  O
more  O
balanced  O
in  O
execution  O
and  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
radish  O
,  O
chilli  O
,  O
hazelnut  O
and  O
ginger  O
flower  O
dressing  O
worked  O
in  O
harmony  O
while  O
the  O
chicken  O
breast  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
4.2/5  O

This  O
is  O
one  O
dish  O
at  O
Halia  O
that  O
everyone  O
is  O
raving  O
about  O
.  O

The  O
Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
but  O
adoresby  O
carnivores  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
innovative  O
dish  O
substituted  O
the  O
lasagna  O
noodles  O
with  O
slices  O
of  O
celeriac  O
.  O

Instead  O
of  O
meaty  O
mixture  O
,  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
mixture  O
of  O
mushroom  O
,  O
thyme  O
,  O
baby  O
spinach  O
,  O
lemon  O
and  O
madeira  O
cream  O
is  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
earthy  O
flavours  O
and  O
the  O
crunchy  O
celeriac  O
opened  O
my  O
eyes  O
to  O
the  O
world  O
of  O
culinary  O
and  O
changed  O
my  O
mindset  O
about  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
.  O

Confit  O
Salmon  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
exquisite  O
Salmon  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
surrounded  O
by  O
a  O
beautiful  O
garden  O
of  O
roast  O
floret  O
,  O
tomato  O
and  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
with  O
vanilla  O
.  O

The  O
pinkish  O
salmon  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

Thetexture  O
of  O
the  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
was  O
smooth  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
enjoy  O
the  O
vanilla  O
flavour  O
with  O
the  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
to  O
just  O
leave  O
out  O
the  O
vanilla  O
.  O

Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O
dish  O
,  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing.The  O
oriental  O
pulled  O
duck  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
while  O
the  O
soba  O
provided  O
the  O
texture  O
contrast.It  O
was  O
something  O
different  O
for  O
a  O
contemporary  O
European  O
cuisine  O
restaurant  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Potato  O
Fries  O
4.2/5  O
and  O
Polenta  O
Coated  O
Asparagus  O
3/5  O

After  O
trying  O
out  O
the  O
the  O
small  O
plates  O
,  O
we  O
had  O
some  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
and  O
Polenta  O
Coated  O
Asparagus  O
(  O

from  O

orders  O
while  O
waiting  O
for  O
our  O
big  O
plates  O
.  O

The  O
potato  O
friesis  O
paired  O
with  O
truffle  O
aioli  O
and  O
piquant  O
mayo  O

while  O
the  O
polenta  O

with  O

The  O
Javanese  O
Spice  O
Maori  O
Lakes  O
Rack  O
of  O
Lamb  O
(  O
$  O
47  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

Served  O
with  O
eggplant  O
puree  O
and  O
red  O
pepper  O
relish  O
,  O
the  O
lamb  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
not  O
gamy  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
sweetness  O
on  O
the  O
lamb  O
,  O
probably  O
from  O
the  O
marination  O
of  O
the  O
javanese  O
spice  O
.  O

(  O

turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
most  O
well  O
received  O
dish  O
for  O
the  O
tonight  O
.  O

Pardon  O
the  O
appearance  O
that  O
looks  O
like  O
2  O
burnt  O
pieces  O
of  O
chicken  O
breasts  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O

and  O
served  O
with  O
sushi  O

separately  O
.  O

Probably  O
my  O
least  O
favourite  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O

the  O
fact  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
real  O
stuff  O

real  O

of  O
words  O
to  O
describe  O
this  O

different  O

Ginger  O

classic  O
is  O
the  O
Ginger  O
Nougat  O
Parfait  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
taken  O
back  O
how  O
spices  O
(  O
ginger  O
,  O
anise  O
,  O
cinnamon  O
)  O
can  O
work  O
beautifully  O
for  O
dessert  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
smartly  O
harmonised  O
with  O
the  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
of  O
pineapple  O
.  O

Sticky  O
Toffee  O
Pudding  O

The  O
Sticky  O
Toffee  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
may  O
look  O
rather  O
boring  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
really  O
quite  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
date  O
pudding  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
was  O
excellently  O
paired  O
with  O
butterscotch  O
sauce  O
,  O

Chocolate  O

The  O
Chocolate  O
and  O
Orange  O
Custard  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
was  O
bursting  O
with  O
richness  O
.  O

The  O
shortbread  O
and  O
almond  O
provided  O
that  O
lovely  O
texture  O
on  O

of  O
the  O

poured  O
into  O

A  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
dessert  O
suitable  O
for  O
the  O
humid  O
Singapore  O
weather  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
nice  O
but  O
soup  O
for  O
dessert  O
is  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

It  O
probably  O
takes  O
a  O
while  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
really  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

We  O

The  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Terrine  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
get  O
me  O
excited  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
foie  O
gras  O
pan  O
seared.Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
pineapple  O
chutneygoes  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
foie  O

.  O

I  O
also  O
enjoyed  O
spreading  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
over  O
the  O
bread  O
and  O
eating  O
it  O
that  O
way  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
black  O
oilve  O
crumber  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
redundant  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
hard  O

like  O
a  O

,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
potatoes  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

It  O
gave  O
that  O
nice  O
extra  O
texture  O
contrast  O
.  O

Topped  O
with  O

,  O
the  O

was  O
a  O

My  O

enjoyed  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Salmon  O
with  O
Fruit  O
Salsa  O
(  O

the  O
most  O
.  O

The  O
salmon  O
was  O
cooked  O

.  O

Cutting  O
into  O
the  O
salmon  O
revealed  O
the  O
pinkish  O
fish  O
meat  O
while  O
the  O
exterior  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
.  O

Accompanied  O
by  O
the  O
refreshing  O

,  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
excellent  O
pairing  O

Tom  O

We  O
already  O
have  O
eateries  O
serving  O
chilli  O

I  O
was  O
eager  O
to  O
try  O
this  O

creation  O
,  O
Tom  O
Yam  O
Spahetti  O
with  O
Seafood  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O

.  O

Taste  O
wise  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
has  O
potential  O
with  O
very  O
distinct  O
and  O
robust  O
flavours  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
believe  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
quality  O
control  O
on  O
the  O
salt  O
,  O
this  O
can  O
be  O
another  O
fusion  O
pasta  O
dish  O
that  O
the  O
new  O
generation  O
will  O
enjoy  O
.  O

Nonya  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Nonya  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
for  O
1pax  O
,  O
$  O
20.90  O
for  O
2pax  O
)  O
with  O
potatoes  O
and  O
carrots  O
served  O
with  O
bread  O
.  O

Many  O
that  O
have  O
visited  O
the  O
bistro  O
gave  O
good  O
reviews  O
for  O
their  O
curry  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
even  O
told  O
that  O
the  O
Indians  O
at  O
Little  O
India  O
also  O
like  O
their  O
Nonya  O
style  O
curry  O
.  O

So  O
did  O
it  O
disappoint  O
me  O
?  O

No  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
prefer  O
Nonya  O
curry  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
curry  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
thick  O
gravy  O
and  O
spices  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
nonya  O
curry  O
chicken  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
large  O
pieces  O
of  O
tender  O
chicken  O
that  O
is  O
rather  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Singaporean  O
probably  O
will  O
know  O
how  O
crowded  O
Little  O
India  O
can  O
be  O
during  O
the  O
weekends  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
Steam  O
Sia  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
quieter  O
side  O
of  O
Little  O
India  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
where  O
I  O
can  O
enjoy  O
a  O
peaceful  O
meal  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
vicinity  O
does  O
not  O
offer  O
many  O
non  O
Indian  O
food  O
eateries  O
,  O
Steam  O
Sia  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
choice  O
for  O
a  O
different  O
.  O

With  O
more  O
budgets  O
hotels  O
being  O
builtin  O
thearea  O
,  O
it  O
may  O
also  O
offer  O
the  O
foreigners  O
a  O
cheaper  O
meal  O
alternative  O

The  O

of  O

The  O

with  O
Foie  O

Meat  O
combination  O
wasinteresting  O
but  O
not  O
my  O
favourite.Similar  O
to  O

,  O
the  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
came  O
with  O
flavourful  O
preserved  O
meat  O

.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
enjoyable  O
sticky  O
and  O

texture  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
foie  O
gras  O
but  O
I  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
to  O
feel  O
it  O
is  O
just  O
a  O
gimmick  O
for  O
pricing  O
purposes  O
for  O
this  O
dish.The  O
foie  O
gras  O
felt  O
separated  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
complement  O
the  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
happy  O
with  O
the  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
with  O
the  O

alone  O

The  O
Steamed  O

with  O

.  O

The  O
buns  O
which  O
is  O
made  O
exclusively  O
by  O
a  O

is  O
light  O

even  O
the  O

I  O
like  O
my  O

did  O
not  O

Fries  O

This  O
is  O
not  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
.  O

Sofries  O
offers  O
it  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
served  O
as  O
french  O
fries  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
to  O
the  O
norm  O
.  O

A  O
little  O
disappointment  O
in  O
how  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

As  O
it  O
was  O
stacked  O
into  O
a  O
glass  O
,  O
the  O
water  O
vapour  O
has  O
caused  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
to  O
be  O
soaky  O
.  O

So  O
what  O
is  O
my  O
verdict  O
of  O
the  O
burger  O
?  O

Is  O
it  O
the  O
best  O
?  O

Yes  O
!  O

I  O
agreed  O
the  O
Omakase  O
Burger  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
in  O
town  O
.  O

However  O
will  O
the  O
burger  O
joint  O
be  O
successful  O
it  O
waits  O
to  O
be  O
seen  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
may  O
have  O
found  O
the  O
right  O
formuale  O
for  O
the  O
best  O
burger  O
but  O
the  O
size  O
and  O
price  O
will  O
be  O
hard  O
to  O
convince  O
consumers  O
.  O

In  O

The  O

is  O
the  O
Bihun  O
Bebek  O
Dry/Soup  O
(  O
$  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
beehoon  O
dry  O
served  O
with  O
duck  O
herbal  O
soup  O
on  O
the  O
side  O

amount  O
of  O
shredded  O
duck  O
,  O
fried  O
garlic  O
,  O
spring  O
onion  O
and  O
bean  O
sprouts.I  O
understand  O
the  O
rice  O
noodle  O
is  O
made  O
in  O
Medan.It  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
unique  O
springy  O

that  O
is  O

from  O

The  O
other  O
dish  O
at  O

my  O
attention  O
is  O
the  O
Nasi  O
Redang  O
Sapi  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
redang  O
was  O
extremely  O
tender  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
flavour  O
that  O
woke  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

At  O
thatinstant  O
,  O
memories  O
of  O
Indonesia  O
trips  O
flashed  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
,  O
an  O
authentic  O
taste  O
that  O
has  O
long  O
been  O
forgotten  O
.  O

I  O

a  O

the  O

Wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
dinner  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Campur  O
Medan  O
(  O
$  O

and  O
Chendol  O
Medan  O
(  O

.  O

Both  O
areshaved  O
ice  O

with  O
coconut  O
milk  O
and  O
palm  O
sugar  O
.  O

The  O
different  O
is  O
the  O
ingredients  O
used  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
Campur  O
Medan  O
over  O
the  O
Chendol  O
Medan  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
chendol  O
was  O
homemade  O
,  O
the  O
colour  O
was  O
unappetising  O
and  O
lacking  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

I  O
previously  O
visited  O
a  O
Medanese  O
cuisine  O
restaurant  O
and  O
was  O
not  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O

.  O

Medan  O

has  O
changed  O
my  O
opinion  O
with  O
Medanese  O

I  O
amglad  O
to  O
discover  O

another  O

With  O
the  O
success  O
story  O
of  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
surprise  O
to  O
see  O
another  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
opening  O
its  O
door  O
for  O
business  O
at  O
neighbourhood  O
area  O
.  O

Soi  O
Thai  O

is  O
established  O
about  O
six  O
months  O
ago  O
at  O
block  O

.  O

Relying  O
on  O
my  O
lunch  O
partner  O
,  O
Maureen  O
's  O
dining  O
experience  O
at  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
she  O
told  O
me  O
the  O
concept  O
at  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
even  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
plates  O
usedfor  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
because  O
I  O
was  O
always  O
turned  O
off  O
by  O
the  O
long  O
queues  O
.  O

Anyway  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
...  O

Thick  O
Tom  O

Soup  O
(  O
prawn  O
)  O
3.8/5  O

Came  O
with  O
fresh  O
prawns  O
and  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
the  O
Thick  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
balanced  O
of  O
sourness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Only  O
disappointmentthere  O
is  O
no  O
seafood  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
more  O
choices  O
in  O
my  O
tom  O
yum  O
soup  O
not  O
just  O
only  O
prawn  O
or  O
chicken  O
.  O

4/5  O

For  O
just  O
a  O
mere  O
6  O
dollar  O
,  O
the  O
portionwas  O
quite  O
worthy  O
.  O

Nicely  O
cooked  O
to  O
a  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Kang  O
Kong  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
very  O
homely  O
flavour  O
.  O

Beef  O
Paneang  O
4.2/5  O

Using  O
beef  O
cheeks  O
for  O
the  O
Beef  O
Paneang  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
style  O
red  O
chilli  O
beef  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
cheeks  O
were  O
extremely  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
not  O
really  O
a  O
spicy  O
dish  O
more  O
towards  O
the  O
sweetness  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
goes  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
very  O
well  O
.  O

Thai  O
Yellow  O
Ginger  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

The  O
Thai  O
Yellow  O
Ginger  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
,  O
nicely  O
coated  O
with  O
the  O
yellow  O
ginger  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
thought  O
the  O
dishcan  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
spicier  O
.  O

Sea  O
Bass  O
with  O
Namjim  O
Larb  O
4.2/5  O

Something  O
for  O
a  O
different  O
this  O
time  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
with  O
Namjim  O
Larb  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
was  O
the  O
Namjim  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Made  O
with  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
garlic  O
,  O
fish  O
sauce  O
,  O
lime  O
juices  O
,  O
sugar  O
and  O
chilli  O
,  O
the  O
sournesswent  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
fish  O
meat  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
minced  O
pork  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Mango  O

Rice  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
Mango  O
Sticky  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
)  O
wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
sumptuous  O
lunch  O
at  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

I  O
consider  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
with  O
the  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
pricing  O
.  O

At  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
send  O
back  O
your  O
food  O
for  O
adjustment  O
if  O
you  O
find  O
it  O
not  O
spicy  O
enough  O
or  O
too  O
spicy  O
to  O
your  O
likings  O
.  O

Now  O
or  O
rather  O
for  O
the  O
moment  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
and  O
reason  O
to  O
skip  O

if  O
I  O

both  O
meticulous  O

it  O

(  O

.  O

The  O
fresh  O

witha  O
nice  O

was  O
very  O
delectable  O
.  O

Miso  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

I  O
was  O
wondering  O
why  O
theMiso  O
Soupwas  O
served  O
in  O
the  O
midde  O
of  O
our  O
meal  O
instead  O
at  O
the  O
beginning  O
which  O
most  O
restaurants  O
do  O
.  O

Unlike  O
others  O
,  O
the  O
miso  O
soup  O
here  O
is  O
only  O
cook  O
a  O
la  O
minute  O
hence  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
salty  O
compared  O
to  O
those  O
thatwas  O
pre-cooked  O
and  O
kept  O
under  O
constant  O
heat  O
.  O

Mango  O
Roll  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Mango  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
30  O
)  O
was  O
beautifully  O
presented  O
but  O
not  O
practical  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
kept  O
sliding  O
down  O
from  O
the  O
sushi  O
roll  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
separated  O
as  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
eat  O
the  O
mango  O
separately  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
sweet  O
enough  O
,  O
lacking  O
the  O
refreshing  O
contrast  O
in  O
taste  O
.  O

Avocado  O
Roll  O

The  O
Avocado  O
Roll  O

Soba  O
4.2/5  O

Not  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
the  O
cold  O
soba  O
made  O
from  O
yam  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
explained  O
that  O
this  O
particular  O
soba  O
is  O
not  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
due  O
to  O
irregular  O
supply  O
from  O
Japan  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
available  O
they  O
will  O
recommend  O
it  O
to  O
the  O
customer  O
.  O

The  O
soba  O
is  O
paler  O
in  O
colour  O
,  O
thinner  O
and  O
smoother  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Have  O
you  O
heard  O
of  O
Bespoke  O
Cocktails  O
?  O

It  O
means  O
walking  O
into  O
a  O
bar  O
and  O
the  O
mixlogist  O
will  O
customise  O
your  O
drink  O
depending  O
on  O
your  O
mood  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
one  O
until  O
recently  O
when  O
I  O
met  O
Maureen  O
for  O
a  O
drink  O
at  O
Bar  O
Stories  O
before  O
our  O
tasting  O
session  O
in  O
the  O
evening  O
.  O

Located  O
among  O
the  O
rows  O
of  O
shophouses  O
at  O
hip  O
Haji  O
lane  O
,  O
the  O
quirky  O
bar  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
difficult  O
to  O
spot  O
.  O

Upon  O
settling  O
down  O
in  O
the  O
bar  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
wondering  O
what  O
to  O
do  O
as  O
there  O
was  O
no  O
menu  O
around  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
who  O
was  O
a  O
table  O
away  O
spotted  O
us  O
and  O
probably  O
he  O
couldtell  O
from  O
our  O
confused  O
face  O
,  O
came  O
over  O
and  O
asked  O
whether  O
it  O
is  O
our  O
first  O
time  O
at  O
Bar  O
Stories  O
.  O

After  O
giving  O
us  O
a  O
brief  O
introduction  O
of  O
the  O
place  O
andchecking  O
what  O
sort  O
oftaste/flavours  O
we  O
like  O
,  O
the  O
owner  O
asked  O
the  O
mixologist  O
tomix  O
a  O
cocktailfor  O
eachof  O
us  O
.  O

Maureen  O
who  O
is  O
crazy  O
with  O
Ispahan  O
requested  O
for  O
her  O
cocktail  O
to  O
come  O
with  O
lychee  O
and  O
rose  O
syrup  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
are  O
not  O
really  O
an  O
alcohol  O
person  O
,  O
the  O
cocktail  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
strong  O
inalcohol  O
content  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

We  O
preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
sweeter  O
.  O

Noticed  O
that  O
Maureen  O
did  O
not  O
finish  O
her  O
drink  O
,  O
the  O
owner  O
made  O
her  O
another  O
glass  O
of  O
cocktail  O
that  O
was  O
more  O
refreshing  O
and  O
sweeter  O
with  O
berries  O
and  O
grapes  O
flavours  O
partying  O
in  O
the  O
glass  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
preferred  O
sour  O
taste  O
,  O
the  O
mixologist  O
made  O
me  O
a  O
passionfruit  O
inspired  O
cocktail  O
.  O

The  O
cocktail  O
was  O
much  O
refreshing  O
and  O
easy  O
to  O
drink  O
compare  O
to  O
Maureen  O
's  O
Ispahan  O
inspired  O
cocktail  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
bespoke  O
cocktails  O
.  O

The  O
excitement  O
and  O
thrill  O
of  O
a  O
different  O
customised  O
cocktail  O
depending  O
on  O
one  O
's  O
mood  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
hidden  O
cocktail  O
bar  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
chill  O
out  O
place  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
with  O
each  O
cocktail  O
ranges  O
from  O

I  O
actually  O
adore  O

Samgyupsal  O

Samgyupsal  O
4.2/5  O

If  O
you  O
noticed  O
,  O
the  O
meat  O
at  O
Bornga  O
is  O
in  O
its  O
natural  O
colour  O
without  O
any  O
pre-marination  O
causing  O
the  O
colour  O
of  O
the  O
meat  O
to  O
be  O
dark  O
brown  O
or  O
black  O
.  O

Concerned  O
about  O
the  O
appearance  O
of  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
meats  O
,  O
Chef  O
Paik  O
created  O
a  O
new  O
Korean  O
style  O
of  O
BBQ  O
while  O
keeping  O
the  O
natural  O
colour  O
and  O
taste  O
of  O
meats  O
.  O

The  O
Samgyupsal  O
or  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
is  O
chosen  O
for  O
the  O
right  O
proportion  O
of  O
fat  O
and  O
meat  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
the  O
grilled  O
pork  O
belly  O
tasted  O
as  O
good  O
or  O
even  O
much  O
better  O
in  O
its  O
natural  O
flavour  O
without  O
marination  O
.  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
star  O
attraction  O
and  O
probably  O
the  O
reason  O
for  O
repeated  O
customers  O
is  O
the  O
Woo  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O
is  O
served  O
shortly  O
after  O
being  O
doused  O
in  O
a  O
unique  O
dressing  O
that  O
retains  O
the  O
meat  O
's  O
natural  O
colour  O
while  O
enhancing  O
the  O
traditional  O
bulgogi  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O
marbledmeat  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

In  O
exact  O
fact  O
,  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
than  O
bulgogi/galbi  O
.  O

I  O
will  O
definitely  O
return  O
for  O
it  O
again  O

Each  O

)  O
which  O
is  O

The  O
silky  O
glass  O
noodles  O
were  O
nicely  O
flavoured  O
by  O
the  O
soy  O

but  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O

Naengmyeon  O

Another  O

,  O
buckwheat  O
noodles  O
with  O
cold  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
best  O
method  O
of  O
eatingcold  O
noodles  O
is  O
to  O
add  O
some  O
mustard  O
and  O
vinegar  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
combinations  O
of  O
sour  O

and  O
spicy  O
was  O
very  O
appetising  O
and  O
refreshing  O

The  O

The  O
haemul  O
pajeon  O
itself  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
bland  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
best  O
enjoyed  O

that  O
the  O

to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
Chef/Owner  O
Marcus  O
Edwin  O
Wu  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
was  O
inspired  O
by  O
Joel  O
Robuchon  O
's  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Ravioli  O
and  O
he  O
created  O
a  O
variation  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
handmade  O
veal  O
ravioli  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
still  O
having  O
a  O
bite  O
to  O
the  O
pasta  O
dough  O
.  O

The  O
deft  O
piece  O
of  O
work  O
with  O
the  O
flavourful  O
truffle  O
porcini  O
sauce  O
was  O
like  O
a  O
match  O
from  O
heaven  O

The  O

was  O
rich  O
and  O
moist  O
which  O
hit  O
the  O
right  O
note  O
for  O
the  O
perfect  O
ending  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
enjoyed  O

is  O
like  O
a  O
multi  O
nation  O
on  O

The  O
octopus  O
is  O
imported  O
from  O
Spain  O
,  O
the  O
tomatoes  O
fromFrance  O
and  O
pumpkin  O
seed  O

from  O
Austrian.This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
with  O
Austrian  O
pumpkin  O
seed  O
oil  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
an  O
aromatic  O
peanut/sesame  O
similarity  O
flavours  O
that  O
paired  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
ingredients  O
on  O

was  O
aged  O
for  O
a  O

was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
absorbing  O
the  O

and  O
had  O
a  O
slight  O

it  O
.  O

had  O
a  O
nice  O
grilled  O
crisp  O
to  O
the  O
skin  O
and  O
a  O
moist  O
interior  O
.  O

Dipping  O
the  O
fish  O
meat  O
with  O
the  O

lifted  O
the  O
flavour  O
to  O
a  O

Cooked  O
in  O

of  O

when  O
he  O

up  O

Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

For  O
starter  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
choice  O
between  O
the  O
Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
or  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
.  O

The  O
Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
with  O
its  O
fresh  O
greens  O
and  O
chunky  O
chicken  O
topped  O
with  O
delectable  O
dressing  O
tantalized  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
grapes  O
gave  O
the  O
salad  O
a  O
fruity  O
and  O
freshing  O
touch  O
.  O

French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
3/5  O

The  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
but  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
agreed  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
also  O
looking  O
for  O
more  O
caramalized  O
onions  O
in  O
the  O
soup  O
for  O
that  O
extra  O
textures  O
and  O
sweetness  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
all  O
there  O
,  O
it  O
just  O
need  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
fine  O
tuning  O
to  O
make  O
it  O
better  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Ballotine  O
4/5  O

Christmas  O
is  O
about  O
turkey  O
but  O
the  O
meat  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
tough  O
and  O
dry  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
done  O
properly  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
usually  O
avoid  O
turkey  O
whenever  O
it  O
is  O
possible  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
like  O
me  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
Chicken  O
Ballotine  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
39  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
nuts  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Just  O
picking  O
bones  O
here  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
brown  O
sauce  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
classic  O
.  O

It  O
will  O
be  O
good  O
if  O
we  O
can  O
have  O
a  O
saucethat  O
is  O
more  O
contrasting  O
and  O
adds  O
colour  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Guinness  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
&  O
Chips  O
4.2/5  O

When  O
I  O
visited  O
Backyard  O
@  O
Dempsey  O
in  O
August  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
Guinness  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
beer  O
for  O
battered  O
fish  O
but  O
the  O
dark  O
colour  O
appearance  O
is  O
not  O
very  O
presentable  O
so  O
they  O
have  O
the  O
Kronenbourg  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
instead  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
excited  O
when  O
I  O
knew  O
I  O
am  O
going  O
to  O
finally  O
taste  O
the  O
Guinness  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
battered  O
fish  O
came  O
with  O
hint  O
of  O
beer  O
flavour  O
,  O
nicely  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

Pork  O
Roulade  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Pork  O
Roulade  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
42  O
)  O
was  O
straight  O
forward  O
with  O
its  O
strong  O
and  O
intense  O
flavours  O
.  O

Meat  O
lover  O
will  O
adore  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Best  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
a  O
bottle  O
of  O
beer  O
.  O

Black  O
Angus  O
Ribeye  O
4.5/5  O

Among  O
the  O
4  O
mains  O
,  O
the  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Ribeye  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
52  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
evening  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
,  O
juicy  O
and  O
flavourful  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
smokiness  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
4/5  O

For  O
the  O
dessert  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
Tiramisu  O
or  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
.  O

The  O
Tiramisu  O
here  O
is  O
without  O
liqueur  O
and  O
on  O
the  O
cheesy  O
side  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
quite  O
like  O
this  O
version  O
as  O
I  O
love  O
my  O
cheese  O
.  O

Creme  O
Brulee  O
2.5/5  O

The  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
was  O
unfortunately  O
not  O
up  O
to  O
expectation  O
.  O

The  O
rich  O
custard  O
base  O
was  O
eggy  O
and  O
lacked  O
the  O
vanilla  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
layer  O
of  O
hard  O
caramel  O
sunk  O
in  O
instead  O
of  O
crackling  O
when  O
I  O
dug  O
my  O
spoon  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
to  O
eat  O
steamboat  O
because  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
joy  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
with  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
people  O
together  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
varieties  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
passed  O
by  O
Teochew  O
Traditional  O
Steamboat  O
Restaurant  O
at  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
on  O
several  O
occasions  O
and  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
always  O
crowded  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
until  O
recently  O
with  O
a  O
group  O
of  O

Dipping  O
Sauces  O

Two  O
types  O
of  O
dipping  O
sauces  O
are  O
served  O
here  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
soy  O
sauce  O
,  O
chopped  O
red  O
chilli  O
,  O
spring  O
onions  O
and  O
fried  O
garlic  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
looking  O
for  O
a  O
more  O
fiery  O
kick  O
,  O
the  O
bright  O
orange  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
will  O
sure  O
break  O
one  O
into  O
a  O
sweat  O
.  O

The  O

The  O

a  O
Teochew  O
himself  O
believes  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
freshness  O
and  O
authenticity  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
determines  O
the  O
quality  O
of  O
the  O
dishes  O
.  O

Only  O
one  O
choice  O
of  O
soup  O

herethat  O
is  O
boiled  O
over  O
5  O

using  O

I  O
understand  O
it  O
is  O
a  O

creation  O
by  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
small  O
in  O

to  O
enjoy  O
it  O
to  O
the  O
fullest  O

Arriving  O
at  O
my  O
destination  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
place  O
very  O
familiar  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
visited  O
the  O
place  O
with  O
my  O
colleagues  O
sometime  O
back  O
and  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
experience  O
.  O

Upon  O
chatting  O
with  O
the  O
new  O
co-owner  O
,  O
he  O
told  O
me  O
they  O
have  O
taken  O
over  O
from  O
the  O
previous  O
owner  O
and  O
kept  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
decor.They  O
have  O
also  O
renamed  O
it  O
to  O
MooJaa  O
,  O
Mookata  O
Thai  O
BBQ  O
Steamboat  O
and  O
revamped  O
the  O
menu  O
offering  O
more  O
authentic  O
and  O
quality  O
food  O
.  O

Fried  O
Salmon  O
Skin  O

While  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Fried  O
Salmon  O
Skin  O
.  O

At  O
MooJaa  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
the  O
Seafood  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
and  O
Chilli  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
each  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
30  O
different  O
ingredients  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
seafood  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
to  O
the  O
chilli  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Dinner  O
was  O
served  O
when  O
everyone  O
arrived.Well  O
not  O
ready  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
to  O
bring  O
out  O
the  O
charcoal  O
first  O
for  O
the  O
Mookata  O
.  O

At  O
MooJaa  O
,  O
premium  O
charcoal  O
was  O
used  O
.  O

It  O
retains  O
the  O
heat  O
better  O
and  O
there  O
wo  O
n't  O
be  O
ashes  O
flying  O
around  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
sure  O
we  O
do  O
n't  O
want  O
the  O
charcoal  O
ashes  O
to  O
fall  O
on  O
our  O
food  O
and  O
spoilt  O

dinner  O

and  O
Set  O

It  O

Set  O

comes  O
with  O

while  O
Set  O
Gai  O
comes  O
with  O

Each  O
set  O
comes  O
with  O
standard  O

such  O
asprawn  O

An  O
important  O
ingredient  O
for  O
Mookata  O
is  O
Pork  O
Lard  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
lard  O
is  O
used  O
to  O
oil  O
the  O
metal  O
dome  O
shape  O
area  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

By  O
doing  O
so  O
,  O
it  O
prevents  O
the  O
ingredients  O
from  O
sticking  O
to  O
the  O
skillet  O
.  O

At  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
,  O
cooking  O
the  O
ingredients  O
with  O
the  O
pork  O
lard  O
oil  O
lift  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

If  O
the  O

in  O
the  O

is  O
not  O
enough  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
order  O
add  O

the  O

We  O
got  O
to  O

Overall  O
I  O
feel  O
that  O
the  O
new  O
owners  O
have  O
brought  O
back  O
quality  O
in  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
grown  O
to  O
accept  O

to  O

.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O

to  O
come  O
across  O
the  O
uncommon  O
Kotob  O
Ubi  O
(  O

1.20/pkt  O
)  O
.  O

Made  O
of  O
mashed  O
tapioca  O
and  O
caramelised  O
grated  O
coconut  O
,  O
the  O
gula  O
melaka  O
is  O
the  O
star  O
as  O
the  O
tapioca  O
and  O
grated  O
coconut  O
was  O
quite  O
bland  O
in  O
nature  O
.  O

Swee  O
3.8/5  O

Kueh  O
Kao  O
Swee  O
(  O
$  O
1.20/pkt  O
)  O
is  O
steamed  O
rice  O
pudding  O
rolled  O
in  O
grated  O
coconut  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
boring  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
it  O
alone  O
without  O
any  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
usually  O
have  O
them  O
withgula  O

The  O
Oneh  O
Oneh  O

1.20/pkt  O
)  O
although  O
was  O
huge  O
the  O
proportion  O
of  O
skin  O
and  O
filling  O
was  O
quite  O
balanced  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
was  O
the  O
lacking  O
of  O
the  O
squirting  O
surprise  O
of  O
gula  O
melaka  O
when  O
biting  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

Ubi  O
(  O

is  O
baked  O
rather  O

The  O
springy  O

chewy  O
texture  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

usually  O
had  O
it  O
for  O

and  O
like  O
to  O
dissect  O
it  O
