Black  O
Hokkien  O

Black  O
Hokkien  O
Mee  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
signature  O
noodle  O
Malaysian  O
dish  O
that  O
every  O
Singaporean  O
would  O
order  O
whenever  O
they  O
visit  O
Malaysia  O
as  O
we  O
hardly  O
find  O
it  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Hokkien  O
Mee  O
here  O
is  O
pretty  O
sinful  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
fried  O
in  O
a  O

full  O
of  O
pork  O

Last  O
Saturday  O
my  O

I  O
met  O
up  O

with  O

Charlene  O
and  O
their  O
partners  O
for  O

at  O

never  O

that  O
there  O
is  O
another  O
Yum  O

restaurant  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
Garden  O
Country  O
Club  O
beside  O

Sake  O
Tapino  O
4.5/5  O

We  O
were  O
here  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
which  O
comes  O
in  O
2  O
sizes  O
at  O
$  O
78  O
(  O
for  O
2-4  O
pax  O
)  O
and  O
$  O
156  O
(  O
for  O
6-8  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
ingredients  O
will  O
be  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
pot  O
of  O
solely  O
Sake  O
Soup  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
wrong  O
.  O

Actually  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
uses  O
pork  O
bone  O
soup  O
as  O
it  O
base  O
and  O
a  O
bottle  O
of  O
Sakewas  O
poured  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

We  O
opt  O
for  O
the  O
waitress  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

First  O
serving  O
was  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
strong  O
Sake  O
flavour  O
soup  O
.  O

Second  O
serving  O
the  O
Sake  O
flavour  O
was  O
milder  O
and  O
we  O
had  O
tofu  O
,  O
prawn  O
and  O
cabbage  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
udon  O
in  O
soup  O
to  O
wrap  O
up  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
feast  O
.  O

Prawn  O
and  O
Beancurd  O
Skin  O
Pancake  O
4/5  O

We  O
actually  O
ordered  O
the  O
6  O
pax  O
set  O
menu  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
the  O
Signature  O
Pomfret  O
Tapino  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
was  O
kind  O
enoughfor  O
us  O
to  O
swap  O
for  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
.  O

Beside  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
,  O
the  O
menu  O
came  O
with  O
Prawn  O
and  O
Beancurd  O
Skin  O
Pancake  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
basically  O
prawn  O
paste  O
stuffed  O
in  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
and  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

Wine  O
Sauce  O
Chicken  O
in  O

3/5  O

Next  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Wine  O
Sauce  O
Chicken  O
served  O
in  O
Hot  O
Stone  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
dish  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
finish  O
as  O
the  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
meat  O
was  O

very  O
good.A  O

down  O

the  O
wire  O
,  O
I  O
will  O

me  O
of  O
MOS  O

Japanese  O
flavours  O
are  O
found  O
between  O

.  O

The  O
signature  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
Sandwich  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
used  O
of  O
Japanese  O
Curry  O
sauce  O
(  O
similar  O
to  O
those  O
Japanese  O
Curry  O
Rice  O
)  O
with  O
the  O
tender  O
chicken  O
fully  O
complement  O
each  O
other  O
that  O
creates  O
a  O
familar  O
but  O
unique  O
taste  O
for  O
a  O
sandwich  O
.  O

Pesto  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

The  O
Italian  O
marinated  O
Pesto  O
Chicken  O
Sandwich  O
has  O
a  O
light  O
herbal  O
basil  O
flavours  O
that  O
give  O
an  O
option  O
for  O
customers  O
who  O
are  O
more  O
health  O
conscious  O
.  O

Teriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
4/5  O

A  O
nice  O
balance  O
of  O
Japanese  O
flavours  O
for  O
theTeriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Sandwich  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
.  O

Maybe  O
it  O
is  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
chicken  O
breast  O
.  O

Tuna  O
with  O
Apple  O
Sandwich  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
Tuna  O
with  O
Apple  O
is  O
very  O
interesting  O
.  O

I  O
asked  O
for  O
the  O
sandwich  O
when  O
I  O
spotted  O
it  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
tuna  O
was  O
done  O
,  O
neither  O
too  O
wet  O
nor  O
dry  O
with  O
too  O
much  O
mayonnaise  O
.  O

The  O
green  O
apple  O
chunks  O
also  O
gave  O
the  O
sandwich  O
a  O
fruity  O
freshness  O
flavour  O
.  O

Marinated  O
Mushrooms  O

a  O
vegetarian  O
,  O
you  O

Mushrooms  O
Sandwich  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
order  O
it  O
but  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
small  O
tastingportion  O
of  O
the  O
marinated  O
mushroom  O
.  O

The  O
assorted  O
mushrooms  O
which  O
are  O
imported  O
from  O
Japan  O
were  O
bursting  O
with  O
flavours  O
with  O
each  O
mouthful  O
.  O

2  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
6  O
ramen  O
restaurants  O

Ramen  O

since  O
there  O

only  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
me  O
.  O

We  O
took  O
quite  O
awhile  O
to  O
decide  O

eventually  O
settled  O
for  O
Menya  O
Iroha  O
and  O
Bario  O

Ramen  O
4.5/5  O

Being  O
named  O
consecutive  O
champion  O
in  O
Tokyo  O
for  O
2009  O
and  O
2010  O
,  O
the  O
Black  O
Shoyu  O
Ramen  O
from  O
Menya  O
Iroha  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
try  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
have  O
this  O
type  O
of  O
black  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
Negitama  O
Ramen  O
came  O
in  O
a  O
clear  O
black  O
shoyu  O
sauce  O
with  O
thin  O
curly  O
noodles  O
,  O
leek  O
,  O
egg  O
,  O
char  O
siew  O
,  O
bamboo  O
shoots  O
and  O
seaweed  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
the  O
black  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
tasted  O
so  O
good  O
!  O

I  O
am  O
definitely  O
won  O
over  O
by  O
it  O
.  O

No  O
wonder  O
it  O
has  O
been  O
consecutive  O
champion  O
in  O
2009  O
and  O
2010  O
.  O

The  O
flavourful  O
broth  O
has  O
a  O
rich  O
soya  O
sauce  O
sweetness  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
sesame  O
aroma  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
brothdid  O
n't  O
give  O
me  O
a  O
greasy  O
after  O
taste  O

and  O
sweet  O

taste  O
but  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
abit  O
greasy  O
.  O

The  O
thick  O
char  O
siew  O
slices  O
that  O
melted  O
in  O

the  O

Elephant  O
Parade  O
is  O
the  O
worlds  O
largest  O
open  O
air  O
art  O
exhibition  O
of  O
decorated  O
elephant  O
statues  O
that  O
seeks  O
to  O
attract  O
public  O
awareness  O
and  O
support  O
for  O
Asian  O
elephant  O
conservation  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Elephant  O
Parade  O
2011  O
came  O
to  O
Singapore  O
back  O
in  O
Novemeber  O
2011  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
to  O
capture  O
all  O
the  O
162  O
life  O
size  O
elephants  O
that  O
are  O
exhibit  O
in  O
various  O
parts  O
of  O
the  O
island  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
past  O
one  O
month  O
plus  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
going  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
taking  O
pictures  O
of  O
these  O
beautiful  O
decorated  O
elephants  O
by  O
international  O
artists  O
and  O
celebrities  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
the  O
rainy  O
season  O
and  O
many  O
times  O
my  O
plan  O
was  O
disrupted  O
or  O
postponed  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
the  O
elephants  O
also  O
started  O
to  O
move  O
around  O
as  O
in  O
not  O
they  O
moved  O
by  O
themselves  O
but  O
transported  O
by  O
forklift  O
to  O
more  O
elephant  O
friendly  O
locations  O
which  O
made  O
it  O
harder  O
to  O
locate  O
them  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
I  O
persisted  O
and  O
finishedthe  O
goal  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
set  O
for  O
myself  O
.  O

Enjoy  O
the  O
snap  O
shoots  O
of  O
the  O
162  O
elephants  O
on  O
parade  O
in  O
Singapore  O
2011  O
below  O

There  O
is  O
still  O
a  O
last  O
chance  O
to  O
view  O
all  O
these  O
162  O
life  O
size  O
elephants  O
gathered  O
together  O
at  O
Singapore  O

Iam  O
glad  O
that  O
someone  O
has  O
franchised  O
Black  O

It  O
sort  O

The  O
Chicken  O
Green  O
Curry  O
is  O
the  O
perfect  O

I  O
love  O
the  O
thick  O
creamy  O

over  O
my  O

.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
also  O
very  O
tender  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
Thai  O
eggplant  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
,  O
cooking  O
it  O
a  O
few  O
more  O

be  O
perfect  O

Prawn  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
Prawn  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
different  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
used  O
quite  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
shallots  O
in  O
the  O
soup  O
.  O

Not  O
sure  O
if  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
reason  O
,  O
the  O

The  O

Kari/Curry  O
Chicken  O

Living  O
ina  O
diverse  O
Singapore  O
society  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
tried  O
many  O
different  O
varieties  O
of  O
curry  O
.  O

The  O
Kari/Curry  O
Chicken  O
at  O
Pondok  O
Rasa  O
is  O
rather  O
different  O
in  O
my  O
own  O
option  O
.  O

Maybe  O
I  O
am  O
more  O
used  O
to  O
the  O
thick  O
,  O
heavyand  O
creamy  O
types  O
of  O
curry  O
gravy  O
that  O
iscommonly  O
foundin  O

find  O
the  O

of  O
bland  O
and  O
watery  O

The  O
Soto  O
Medan  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
beautiful  O
greenish  O
gravy  O
with  O
fresh  O
prawns  O
swimming  O
inside  O
.  O

Like  O
the  O
Kari/Curry  O
Chicken  O
's  O
gravy  O
,  O
I  O
prefer  O
something  O
more  O
thick  O
,  O
heavy  O

Pecel  O

another  O
uniquely  O
Indonesian  O
dish  O
.  O

Pecel  O
which  O
is  O
vegetables  O

,  O
tempeh  O
,  O

I  O
have  O
mentioned  O
in  O
previous  O

that  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
fancy  O
this  O
dish  O
as  O
I  O
personally  O
find  O
the  O
combination  O
weird  O
.  O

is  O
defintely  O
the  O
surprise  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O

Sekoteng  O

The  O
Sekoteng  O
at  O
Pondok  O
Rasa  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
Chinese  O
dessert  O
Cheng  O

.  O

It  O
was  O
sweet  O
and  O
refreshing  O
with  O
ingredients  O
like  O
corn  O

,  O
dried  O
orange  O
skin  O
and  O

Likewise  O

Pisang  O
Bumbu  O
(  O
Banana  O

)  O
4/5  O

The  O
Pisang  O
Bumbu  O
is  O
the  O
owner  O
's  O
favourite  O
childhood  O
food  O
and  O
the  O
Chef  O
has  O
recreated  O
the  O
dish  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
.  O

The  O
Banana  O
Fritter  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
exactly  O
the  O
way  O
the  O
owner  O
likes  O
to  O
eat  O
it  O
in  O
his  O
childhood  O
days  O
.  O

Is  O
this  O
a  O
dessert  O
dish  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
from  O
the  O
banana  O
and  O
savoury  O
from  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
?  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
fish  O
and  O
chips  O
looks  O
alike  O
banana  O
fritter  O
without  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
is  O
already  O
a  O
winner  O

Cold  O

4.2/5  O

I  O
find  O
the  O
Kolak  O
Pisang  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
local  O
dessert  O
Bo  O
Bo  O
Cha  O
Cha  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
the  O
same  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
sweet  O
cocont  O

,  O
tapioca  O
and  O
sweet  O
potato  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
served  O
either  O
cold  O
or  O
hot  O
.  O

The  O
different  O
is  O
corn  O

are  O
added  O
to  O

Congee  O
with  O
Pig  O
Intestine  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Congee  O
with  O
Pig  O
Intestine  O
has  O
an  O
interesting  O
chinese  O
dish  O
name  O
called  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
was  O
smooth  O
and  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
meat  O
balls  O
andfried  O
innards  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
spiciness  O
which  O
was  O
rather  O
interesting  O
but  O
can  O
be  O
subjective  O
to  O
individual  O

taste  O

Spare  O
Ribs  O
with  O
Pumpkin  O
4/5  O

Spare  O
Ribs  O
with  O
Pumpkin  O
,  O
thedish  O
sounds  O
interesting  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
what  O
sort  O
of  O
uniquecreation  O
or  O
flavours  O
that  O
will  O
excite  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
just  O
having  O
a  O
few  O
slices  O
of  O
pumpkin  O
sitting  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
steamed  O
with  O
the  O
spare  O
ribs  O
together  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
taste  O
any  O
pumpkin  O
flavours  O
anywhere  O
in  O
the  O
dish  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
pumpkin  O
slices  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
spare  O
ribs  O
were  O
nice  O
and  O
meaty  O
.  O

I  O
hate  O
to  O
have  O
those  O
that  O
only  O
have  O
ribs  O
but  O

.  O

The  O

versionwas  O
light  O

in  O
a  O

the  O

of  O

I  O
get  O
to  O
know  O
of  O
this  O
restaurant  O
after  O
watching  O
a  O
TV  O
shows  O
on  O
buffet  O
places  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
Saturday  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
with  O
my  O
friend  O
's  O
family  O
going  O
around  O
Singapore  O
taking  O
pictures  O
of  O
the  O
life-sizeelephant  O
exhibitof  O
the  O
Elephant  O
Parade  O
Singapore  O
2011  O
and  O
I  O
suggested  O
Bumbu  O
Restaurant  O
for  O
dinner  O
.  O

Walking  O
into  O
the  O
2  O
storey  O
pre-war  O
house  O
is  O
like  O
stepping  O
back  O
into  O
a  O
bygone  O
era  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
decorated  O
with  O
antique  O
furniture  O
and  O
artifacts  O
everywhere  O
as  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
antique  O
museum  O
.  O

The  O
Indo  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
both  O
ala  O
carte  O
and  O
buffet  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

We  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
buffet  O
which  O
cost  O
$  O
16.80+  O
per  O
adult  O
and  O
$  O
8.40+  O
for  O
children  O
under  O
10  O
years  O
old  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
about  O
23  O
mainsand  O
16  O
desserts/drinks  O
on  O
the  O
buffet  O
menu  O
.  O

Tahu  O
Telor  O
4.2/5  O

Unlike  O
the  O
usual  O
Tahu  O
Telorthat  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
one  O
big  O
piece  O
,  O
the  O
Tahu  O
(  O
Tofu  O
)  O
here  O
came  O
in  O
small  O
pieces  O
.  O

It  O
looked  O
mediocre  O
but  O
itwas  O
really  O
verygood  O
.  O

The  O
Tahu  O
wasvery  O
soft  O
and  O
smooth  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Fried  O
Egg  O
Salad  O

What  O
a  O
weird  O
combination  O
of  O
Seafood  O
and  O
Fried  O
Egg  O
as  O
a  O
salad  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
Seafood  O
Fried  O
Egg  O
Salad  O
was  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
lime  O
sauce  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
spicinessthat  O
married  O
both  O
the  O
seafood  O
and  O
fried  O
egg  O
into  O
a  O
delightful  O
salad  O
.  O

Gado  O
Gado  O

Gado  O
Gado  O
is  O
a  O
typical  O
Indonesia  O
dish  O
whereby  O
vegetablesare  O
served  O
in  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
do  O
n't  O
fancy  O
the  O
dish  O
because  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
weird  O
to  O
eat  O
vegetablein  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
itself  O
was  O
really  O
nutty  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Steam  O
Fish  O
Spicy  O
Lime  O
Sauce  O
4/5  O

The  O
Steam  O
Fish  O
Spicy  O
Lime  O
Sauce  O
was  O
simple  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
nice  O
.  O

The  O
boneless  O
fish  O
slices  O
were  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
for  O
the  O
kids  O
and  O
they  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
.  O

Fried  O
Fish  O
Slice  O
House  O
Chilli  O
3.5/5  O

I  O
find  O
the  O
Fried  O
Fish  O
Slice  O
House  O
Chilli  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
house  O
chilli  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
wow  O
me  O
.  O

Sweet  O
Sour  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

Bumbu  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
Indo  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
not  O
sure  O
why  O
the  O
Sweet  O
Sour  O
Chicken  O
dish  O
is  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
although  O
they  O
substitute  O
pork  O
with  O
chicken  O
since  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
Halal  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fry  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Egg  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Stir  O
Fry  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Egg  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
fluffy  O
and  O
creamytexture  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
the  O
kids  O
favourite  O
dish  O
.  O

Sambal  O
Kangkong  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
think  O
Sambal  O
Kangkong  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
vegetable  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
realized  O
I  O
usually  O
order  O
it  O
when  O
I  O
dine  O
outside  O
.  O

The  O
belacan  O
chilli  O
infused  O
with  O
the  O
kangkong  O
was  O
really  O
shiok  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
not  O
overcooked  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
crunchiness  O
that  O
I  O
like  O
.  O

Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
3.5/5  O

I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappinted  O
with  O
the  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
rubbery  O
which  O
did  O
not  O
justify  O
for  O
the  O
flavourful  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
.  O

Cold  O
Tofu  O
with  O
Preserved  O
Egg  O
4.5/5  O

You  O
do  O
n't  O
often  O
get  O
to  O
find  O
Cold  O
Tofu  O
with  O
Preserved  O
Egg  O
served  O
at  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
tried  O
this  O
dish  O
in  O
Taiwan  O
and  O
I  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
cold  O
tofu  O
was  O
tasteless  O
but  O
paired  O
withpreserved  O
egg  O
,  O
salted  O
egg  O
and  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
just  O
turnedinto  O
a  O
verybeautiful  O
dish  O
.  O

Mini  O
Spring  O
Roll  O
4/5  O

The  O
Mini  O
Spring  O
Roll  O
surprised  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
used  O
Otak  O
for  O
the  O
spring  O
roll  O
's  O
filling  O
!  O
It  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O
and  O
unique  O
combination  O
.  O

The  O
spring  O
roll  O
was  O
fried  O
perfectly  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
colouring  O
and  O
the  O
skin  O
was  O
very  O
crispy  O
.  O

You  O
may  O
realized  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
post  O
any  O
dessert  O
pictures  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
so  O
full  O
that  O
we  O
could  O
not  O
eat  O
anymore  O
desserts  O

A  O
tip  O
from  O
Chef  O
Eric  O
on  O
how  O
to  O
know  O
whether  O
the  O
scallop  O
is  O
cooked  O
is  O
to  O
use  O
your  O
fingers  O
and  O
press  O
the  O
scallop  O
.  O

If  O
it  O
feels  O
spongy  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
almost  O
done  O
.  O

Whenever  O
I  O
am  O
down  O
at  O
Orchard  O
Road  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
have  O
difficulty  O
deciding  O
where  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
lunch/dinner  O
mainly  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
crowd  O
and  O
price  O
.  O

Last  O
weekend  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Orchard  O
Road  O
shopping  O
for  O
Christmas  O
gifts  O
and  O
I  O
happened  O
to  O
walk  O
passed  O
this  O
interesting  O
Hainanese  O
Boneless  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
restaurant  O
on  O
the  O
fifth  O
floor  O
of  O
Far  O
East  O
Plaza  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
rather  O
small  O
with  O
a  O
narrow  O
walkway  O
.  O

Do  O
expect  O
to  O
share  O
tables  O
with  O
others  O
and  O
sitting  O
shoulder  O
to  O
shoulder  O
with  O
other  O
customers  O
.  O

Hainanese  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
restaurant  O
serves  O
both  O
the  O
Boiled  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Roasted  O
Chicken  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Boiled  O
Chicken  O
which  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
jelly  O
like  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
fat  O
compared  O
to  O
some  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
though  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
meat  O
also  O
seems  O
whiter  O
in  O
colour  O
.  O

Not  O

not  O

the  O
Pork  O

The  O

was  O

the  O

was  O
a  O

Dessert  O
Tea  O
4.5/5  O

For  O
a  O
start  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Dessert  O
Tea  O
whichwas  O
an  O
unique  O
and  O
interesting  O
combination  O
of  O
tea  O
and  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
French  O
Rose  O
Tea  O
with  O
Champagne  O
Vanilla  O
Gelato  O
and  O
Oolong  O
Tea  O
with  O
Lychee  O
Martini  O
Gelato  O
.  O

The  O
Dessert  O
Tea  O
definitely  O
won  O
our  O
hearts  O
with  O
the  O
innovative  O
and  O
refreshing  O
concept  O
.  O

The  O
Dessert  O
Tea  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
small  O
cup  O
of  O
the  O
tea  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
warm  O
touch  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
true  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
freshly  O
brewed  O
tea  O
's  O
quality  O
.  O

Double  O

The  O
Double  O
Teasery  O
came  O
with  O
6  O
mini  O
bites  O
and  O
cold  O
cuts  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
top  O
plate  O
,  O
there  O
were  O
the  O
Signature  O
Crispy  O
Wraps  O
and  O
Apple  O
Cake  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Wraps  O
with  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
was  O
an  O
unique  O
creation  O
using  O
Roti  O
Prata  O
to  O
wrap  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
your  O
filling  O
.  O

The  O
plain  O
looking  O
Apple  O
Cake  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
moist  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
Double  O
Teasery  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Crispy  O
Wraps  O
with  O
Roasted  O
Beef  O
and  O
Orange  O
Cake  O
.  O

Both  O
were  O
excellent  O
too  O

The  O

rich  O
savoury  O
,  O
buttery  O

was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O

Among  O
all  O
,  O
the  O
Crabmeat  O

served  O
with  O

was  O
our  O

To  O
ensure  O
the  O

wok  O
up  O
authentic  O
Malaysian  O
dishes  O
,  O
a  O
Malaysian  O
chef  O
was  O

A  O

Claypot  O
KLBak  O
Kut  O

was  O
perfect  O
forthe  O
cold  O
and  O

day  O
.  O

The  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
Char  O
Tar  O
Beehoon  O
(  O
Burnt  O
Beehoon  O
)  O
and  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
what  O
to  O
expect  O
.  O

Apparently  O
Char  O
Tar  O
Beehoon  O
is  O
a  O
popular  O
dish  O
in  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

The  O
beehoon  O
was  O
soft  O
and  O
tasty  O
but  O
lacked  O
the  O
crispy  O
crust  O
that  O
held  O
the  O
beehoon  O
together  O
.  O

4.5/5  O

Thumbs  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
Signature  O
Tofu  O
that  O
the  O
Chef  O
makes  O
everyday  O
.  O

The  O
Tofu  O
was  O
very  O
smooth  O
and  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

Topped  O
with  O
deep  O
fried  O
golden  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
dish  O
a  O
contrast  O
texture  O
that  O
was  O
delightful  O
to  O
be  O
eatenalone  O
or  O

with  O
the  O

4.2/5  O

I  O
usually  O
avoid  O
having  O

when  O
I  O
dine  O
outside  O
to  O
avoid  O
dirtying  O

Not  O

when  O
you  O
have  O
the  O
Garlic  O
Steamed  O
Prawns  O
at  O
Shi  O

The  O

split  O
into  O
halves  O
and  O
topped  O
with  O
both  O
fresh  O
and  O
deep  O

garlic  O
.  O

The  O
prawns  O
were  O
very  O
fresh  O
and  O
the  O
meat  O
came  O
of  O
the  O
shells  O
with  O
ease  O

I  O
had  O
the  O

whichwas  O
a  O

disappointing  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
crab  O
meat  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
juicy  O
,  O
the  O
Tanghoon  O
was  O
bland  O

Every  O
week  O
the  O

will  O
create  O
a  O
new  O

and  O
the  O
Crispy  O
Pork  O
Rib  O
Drumlets  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
his  O
new  O
creations  O
previous  O
week  O
.  O

The  O
Pork  O
Rib  O
Drumlet  O
is  O
first  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
perfection  O
and  O
then  O
braised  O
with  O
in  O
house  O
special  O
sauce  O
to  O
bring  O
out  O
its  O
full  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
2  O
cooking  O
methods  O
gave  O
the  O
pork  O
rib  O
an  O
unique  O
texture  O
which  O
tantalize  O
the  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

This  O
week  O
the  O
Chef  O
created  O
the  O
3  O
Treasure  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
Wrap  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O
sea  O

is  O
stuffed  O
with  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O
succulent  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
fresh  O
sliced  O
pork  O
and  O
nutritious  O
carrot  O
steamed  O
with  O

Its  O

a  O

demonstrations  O
through  O
the  O
showcase  O
kitchen  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
food  O
tasting  O
session  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
introduced  O
to  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
signature  O
local  O
favourites  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
on  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
Kitchen  O
menu  O
.  O

First  O
up  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
handrolled  O
Popiah  O
filled  O
withrefreshing  O
shredded  O
vegetables  O
,  O
bamboo  O
shoot  O
,  O
minced  O
pork  O
and  O
mushroom  O
,  O
prawn  O
and  O
egg  O
slices.I  O
disliked  O
Popiah  O
that  O
is  O
wet  O
and  O
messy  O
to  O
eat  O
with.Thumbs  O
up  O
to  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
the  O
fresh  O
Popiah  O
skin  O
although  O
thin  O
can  O
be  O
easily  O
picked  O
up  O
without  O
the  O
ingredients  O
falling  O
apart  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
the  O
Popiah  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
with  O
diners  O
.  O

Almost  O
every  O
table  O
ordered  O
it  O
.  O

Popiah  O
4.5/5  O

Next  O
I  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Rojak  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprised  O
that  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
has  O
their  O
own  O
sauce  O
mix  O
for  O
making  O
the  O
Rojak  O
.  O

The  O
Rojak  O
sauce  O
mix  O
was  O
really  O
good  O
!  O

It  O
tasted  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
Rojak  O
stalls  O
oreven  O
better.These  O
stalls  O
can  O
probablyconsider  O
buying  O
the  O
Rojak  O
sauce  O
mix  O
from  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
instead  O
.  O

Hainanese  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
signature  O
dishes  O
at  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

The  O
poached  O
chicken  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
jelly  O
like  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
chicken-flavoured  O
rice  O
was  O
not  O
oily  O
and  O
very  O
fragrant  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
medley  O
of  O
chilli  O
,  O
ginger  O
and  O
black  O
soya  O
sauces  O
to  O
further  O

Laksa  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
local  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
high  O
expectation  O
when  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Laksa  O
here  O
.  O

The  O
Laksa  O
has  O
a  O
rich  O
and  O
spicy  O
coconut  O
gravy  O
which  O
did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
me  O
.  O

with  O
rice  O
noodles  O
,  O
prawns  O
,  O

cake  O
,  O

purchased  O
at  O

you  O
intend  O
to  O

For  O
a  O
good  O
bowl  O
of  O
Prawn  O
Mee  O
it  O
is  O
all  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
soup  O
that  O
makes  O
the  O
different  O
.  O

It  O
must  O
have  O
the  O
prawny  O
taste  O
andflavour  O
fromhours  O
of  O
brewing  O

.  O

is  O
also  O
used  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
Fried  O

Mee  O
dish  O
!  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
pretty  O
cool  O
.  O

Getting  O
a  O
pack  O
of  O
Prawn  O
Mee  O
mix  O
and  O
you  O
can  O
cook  O
two  O
different  O

I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
semi  O
wet  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Fried  O
Hokkien  O
Mee  O
that  O
infused  O
with  O

Many  O
of  O
my  O
work  O

to  O
get  O

whenever  O
they  O
are  O

Now  O
they  O

sample  O
both  O
the  O
dish  O
and  O
purchase  O
the  O
product  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
location  O
.  O

The  O
Teochew  O
style  O
Bak  O
Kut  O
Teh  O
has  O
very  O
tender  O
pork  O
ribs  O
which  O
came  O
of  O
the  O
bone  O
easily  O
.  O

The  O
peppery  O
soup  O
came  O
witha  O
mild  O
herbal  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
balance  O
not  O
overpowering  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

Personally  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
peppery  O
.  O

The  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
has  O
a  O
rich  O
and  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
lacked  O
the  O
spiciness  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
.  O

Anyway  O
itis  O
just  O
a  O
personally  O
preference.The  O
dish  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
white  O
rice  O
but  O
you  O
can  O
request  O
for  O
the  O
chicken-flavoured  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
goes  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
either  O

The  O
Grass  O

with  O

in  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
pedestrian  O
but  O
a  O
refreshing  O
dessert  O
after  O
a  O
hot  O
day  O
shopping  O
at  O
Orchard  O

.  O

The  O
Chendol  O
on  O

was  O
a  O
beautiful  O
dessert  O
with  O
its  O
sweet  O
and  O
strong  O
flavours  O
coming  O
from  O
the  O
Gula  O

It  O
would  O
make  O
the  O

smoother  O
if  O

could  O
be  O
finer  O

just  O
do  O
n't  O

Last  O
Monday  O
was  O
a  O
public  O
holiday  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
a  O
morning  O
forest  O
walk  O
starting  O
from  O
Henderson  O
Wave  O
,  O
intending  O
to  O
end  O
on  O
the  O

end  O
at  O
Alexandra  O
Arch  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
the  O
forest  O
walk  O
was  O
under  O
repair  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
turn  O
back  O
for  O
an  O
early  O
lunch  O
.  O

I  O
took  O
a  O

.  O

This  O
place  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
with  O
taxi  O
uncle  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
taxi  O
parked  O
at  O
the  O
carpark  O
behind  O
the  O
coffee  O
shop  O
and  O
taxi  O
uncles  O

Pork  O
Chop  O

Unlike  O
the  O
norm  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
served  O
at  O
other  O
places  O
,  O
the  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
here  O
came  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
pool  O
of  O
gravy  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
the  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
and  O
the  O
gravy  O
just  O
came  O
together  O
as  O
one  O
dish  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
way  O
,  O
it  O
sort  O
of  O
given  O
the  O

a  O
succulent  O

Like  O
all  O

Hainanese  O
dish  O
,  O
the  O
taste  O
is  O
more  O
inclined  O
to  O
the  O
sweet  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
squid  O
was  O
nice  O
and  O
fresh  O
but  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
springy  O

of  O
mild  O

having  O
said  O
that  O

did  O
not  O
overshadow  O
the  O
piece  O

Live  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crabs  O

Singaporean  O
loves  O
eating  O
crab  O
and  O
usually  O
what  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
is  O
Sri  O
Lankan  O
Crab  O
or  O
from  O
the  O
nearby  O
regions  O
.  O

When  O
Marshal  O
from  O
Wilshire  O
Select  O
Seafood  O
wrote  O
to  O
me  O
for  O
a  O
live  O
hand  O
imported  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
Tasting  O
session  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
resist  O
trying  O
out  O
this  O
species  O
of  O
crab  O
which  O
is  O
not  O
easily  O
available  O
here  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Crab  O

Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
weights  O
around  O
0.7kg  O
to  O
1.4kg  O
and  O
is  O
harvested  O
from  O
the  O
icy  O
waters  O
of  O
Southeast  O
Alaska  O
down  O
to  O
San  O
Franciso  O
Bay  O
.  O

To  O
introduce  O
us  O
to  O
these  O
highly  O
prized  O
delicacy  O
flown  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
from  O
Seattle  O
,  O
Marshal  O
asked  O
the  O
kitchen  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
crabs  O
in  O
6  O
different  O
local  O
cooking  O
styles  O
.  O

Crab  O
Bee  O
Hoon  O

The  O
distinct  O
characteristic  O
of  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
is  O
its  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
a  O
firm  O
scallop  O
like  O
texture  O
.  O

This  O
consistency  O
in  O
texturewas  O
found  O
in  O
all  O
the  O
crabs  O
that  O
was  O
prepared  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
claws  O
and  O
legs  O
have  O
the  O
same  O
firmness  O
in  O
its  O
flesh  O
throughout  O
.  O

In  O
terms  O
of  O
taste  O
,  O
it  O
exudes  O
a  O
deep  O
oceanic  O
,  O
rich  O
buttery  O
and  O
slightly  O
sweet  O
taste  O
.  O

Golden  O
Sand  O

I  O
think  O
the  O
scallop  O
like  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
hit  O
with  O
Singaporean  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
readily  O
available  O
.  O

Ithas  O
also  O
excelled  O
in  O
the  O
different  O
localcooking  O
styles  O
which  O
can  O
satisfy  O
all  O
the  O
different  O
Singaporean  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
a  O
great  O
thank  O
you  O
to  O
both  O
Marshal  O
and  O
Stefanie  O
for  O
the  O
invitation  O
and  O
wonderful  O
crab  O
tasting  O
feast  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
interested  O
in  O
importing  O
the  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
,  O
you  O
can  O

Quite  O
sometime  O
back  O
I  O
went  O
back  O
to  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
with  O
a  O
few  O
friends  O
.  O

Actually  O
wanted  O
to  O
introduce  O
them  O
to  O
the  O
Cool  O
Noodles  O
here  O
after  O
we  O
were  O
all  O
too  O
full  O
after  O
a  O
food  O
tasting  O
session  O
.  O

We  O
ended  O
up  O
having  O
tea  O
and  O
cakes  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
interested  O
to  O
read  O
about  O
the  O
Cool  O
Noodles  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
read  O

here  O
.  O

The  O
core  O
business  O
of  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
is  O
still  O
their  O
Baumkuchens  O
.  O

Baumkuchen  O
is  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
layered  O
cake  O
origin  O
from  O
Germany.It  O
is  O
literally  O
translated  O
as  O
``  O
tree  O
cake  O
''  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
rings  O
formed  O
from  O
the  O
different  O
layers  O
of  O
the  O
cake  O
.  O

Baumkuchen  O
was  O
later  O
introduced  O
in  O
Japan  O
and  O
became  O
popular  O
.  O

Green  O
Tea  O
Baumkuchen  O
4/5  O

For  O
the  O
plain  O
Baumkuchens  O
,  O
we  O
shared  O
the  O
Green  O
Tea  O
and  O
Classic  O
Original  O
flavours  O
.  O

Actually  O
Baumkuchen  O
resembles  O
Kueh  O
Lapis  O
.  O

another  O
type  O
of  O
layered  O
cake  O
that  O
is  O
popular  O
in  O
South  O
East  O
Asia  O
.  O

However  O
Baumkuchen  O
has  O
a  O
firmer  O
texture  O
and  O
at  O
least  O
at  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
there  O
are  O
different  O
flavours  O
to  O
cater  O
for  O
different  O
palates  O
.  O

Classic  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
innovative  O
and  O
creative  O
of  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
to  O
transform  O
the  O
traditional  O
Baumkuchen  O
into  O
a  O
modern  O
delicacy  O
with  O
different  O
toppings  O
like  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
cupcakes  O
.  O

These  O
injection  O
of  O
modern  O
elements  O
into  O
a  O
traditional  O
snack  O
definitely  O
will  O
help  O
to  O
capture  O
the  O
taste  O
buds  O
of  O
the  O
new  O
generations  O

Just  O
a  O

is  O

Hainanese  O

This  O

The  O
firstthing  O
that  O
caught  O
my  O

was  O
the  O
steamed  O
Minced  O
PorkPattythat  O
was  O
shaped  O
into  O
a  O
huge  O
ball  O
shape  O
.  O

The  O
patty  O
was  O
nicely  O
marinated  O
with  O
a  O
springy  O
texture  O
.  O

Minced  O

The  O
Sotong  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
overcooked  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
firm  O
and  O
springy  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
was  O
also  O
too  O
sweet  O
for  O
me.I  O
would  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
on  O
the  O
spicy  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
was  O
not  O
up  O
to  O
my  O
mark  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
it  O
too  O
bland  O
and  O
watery  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
not  O
spicy  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
this  O

is  O
a  O
bit  O

then  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
very  O
popular  O

The  O

off  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O

When  O
Charlene  O
told  O
me  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
to  O
look  O
up  O
on  O
the  O
web  O
and  O
found  O
several  O
results  O
.  O

Some  O
sites  O
refer  O
this  O
placeas  O
``  O
Wen  O
Dao  O
Shi  O
''  O
while  O
others  O
called  O
it  O
``  O
126  O
Dim  O
Sum  O
''  O
.  O

After  O
piecing  O
the  O
different  O
information  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
they  O
are  O
referring  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
place  O
.  O

Actually  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
wondering  O
why  O
the  O
Dim  O
Sum  O
place  O
is  O
called  O
Wen  O
Dao  O
Shi  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
it  O
sounds  O
quite  O
funny  O
in  O
Chinese  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
pointed  O
out  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
actuallypronounced  O
as  O
``  O
Wan  O
Dou  O
Sek  O
''  O
in  O
Cantonese  O
,  O
meaning  O
found  O
a  O
place  O
to  O
eat  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
the  O
stall  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
unit  O
126  O
which  O
also  O
sounds  O
like  O
``  O
Wan  O
Dou  O

''  O
(  O
``  O

''  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
Egg  O
Tart  O
was  O
not  O
the  O
flaky  O

type.It  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
glossy  O
and  O
shiny  O
surface  O
.  O

The  O

was  O

Following  O
the  O
phenomenon  O
of  O
Bubble  O
Tea  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
the  O
new  O
version  O
of  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
has  O
followed  O
.  O

This  O
type  O
of  O
beancurd  O
is  O
unlike  O
your  O
tradition  O
beancurd  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
sweeter  O
,  O
smoother  O
and  O
has  O
a  O
pudding  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
was  O
invented  O
by  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
Soya  O
Beancurdat  O
Old  O
Airport  O
Road  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
popular  O
that  O
it  O
opened  O
another  O
stall  O
at  O
Maxwell  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Lately  O
,  O
many  O
stalls  O
have  O
also  O
followed  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
Soya  O
Beancurd  O
and  O
started  O
selling  O
the  O
chilled  O
version  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
can  O
now  O
be  O
founded  O
at  O
almost  O
every  O
corner  O
of  O
Singapore  O
.  O

At  O
Toa  O
Payoh  O
Lorong  O

Food  O
Centre  O
,  O
I  O
noticed  O
2  O
stalls  O
selling  O
it  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
.  O

After  O
my  O
dinner  O
at  O
Toa  O
Payoh  O
Lorong  O

Food  O
Centre  O
,  O
I  O
bought  O
4  O
tubs  O
of  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
home  O
from  O
B  O
for  O

.  O

beancurd  O
for  O
their  O
beancurd  O
.  O

What  O
interests  O
me  O
is  O
they  O
have  O
different  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
bought  O
the  O
strawberry  O
,  O
chocolate  O
,  O
yam  O
and  O
original  O
flavours  O
.  O

They  O
also  O
have  O
almond  O
,  O
peanut  O
,  O
green  O
teaand  O
blueberry  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
was  O
nice  O
and  O
smooth  O
comparable  O
to  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
Soya  O
Beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
sweet  O
though  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
4  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
original  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
strawberry  O
and  O
yam  O
flavours  O
were  O
not  O
distinct  O
while  O
the  O
chocolate  O
version  O
tasted  O
more  O
like  O
Milo  O
.  O

The  O
Calamares  O
a  O

indeed  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
choice  O
.  O

The  O
freshly  O

in  O

brought  O
out  O
the  O

taste  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
squid  O
was  O
also  O
soft  O
and  O
not  O
chewy  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
tapas  O
dish  O
we  O
had  O
was  O
Patatas  O
Bravas  O
,  O
roast  O
potato  O
in  O
Romesco  O
sauce  O
and  O
Alioli  O
sauce  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
few  O
pieces  O
of  O
potatoto  O
cost  O
$  O
10.80  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
rather  O
expensive  O
and  O
not  O
worth  O
.  O

Patatas  O
Bravas  O

The  O
Crema  O
de  O
Mariscos  O
or  O
Cream  O
Seafood  O
Soup  O
was  O
hearty  O
and  O
comforting  O
.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
quite  O
flavourful  O
from  O
the  O
fresh  O
mussels  O
,  O
calamari  O
,  O
fish  O
and  O
prawns  O
.  O

In  O
the  O

was  O

,  O
a  O
clear  O
soup  O
of  O
pork  O
,  O
beef  O
,  O
chicken  O
and  O

beans.It  O
tasted  O
like  O
Chinese  O
tonic  O
soup  O
.  O

Crema  O

The  O
huge  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
got  O
us  O
excited  O
when  O
served  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
was  O
not  O
enough  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
ask  O
the  O
waitress  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

Meat  O
was  O
a  O

The  O
iconic  O
dish  O
for  O
any  O
Spanish  O
restaurant  O
would  O
be  O
the  O
Paella  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
sort  O
of  O
a  O
National  O
dish  O
regarded  O
by  O
most  O
originating  O
from  O
Valencia  O
.  O

The  O
Paella  O
at  O
Serenity  O
uses  O
Boomba  O
rice  O
,  O
a  O
short  O
grain  O
varietal  O
.  O

This  O
type  O
of  O
grain  O
is  O
able  O
to  O
absorb  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
3  O
times  O
more  O
than  O
normal  O
rice  O
.  O

Similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chineseclaypot  O
rice  O
,  O
Paella  O
is  O
enjoyed  O
with  O
a  O
slight  O
burnt  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
base  O
of  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

Paella  O
Valenciana  O

We  O
have  O
both  O
the  O
Paella  O
Valenciana  O
(  O
saffron  O
,  O
chicken  O
,  O
Spanish  O
chorizo  O
,  O
tiger  O
prawns  O
,  O
squid  O
,  O
half  O
shell  O
mussels  O
,  O
rice  O
)  O
and  O
Arroz  O

(  O
Squid  O
ink  O
,  O
squid  O
,  O
tiger  O
prawns  O
,  O
capsicum  O
,  O
rice  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
nature  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
were  O
well  O
absorbed  O
by  O
the  O
grain  O
infusing  O
the  O
dish  O
with  O
more  O
flavours  O
.  O

Arroz  O
Negro  O

The  O
Paellas  O
are  O
prepared  O
freshly  O
to  O
orderand  O
it  O
takes  O
30-45  O
minutes  O
of  O
preparation  O
time  O
.  O

So  O
remember  O
to  O
order  O
early  O
to  O
avoid  O
a  O
long  O
wait  O

there  O
for  O
dinner  O
,  O
it  O

about  O
9pm  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O

their  O

most  O
of  O
the  O

Upon  O
being  O
ushered  O
to  O
my  O
table  O
,  O
I  O
noticed  O
the  O
RamenPlay  O
's  O
special  O
Chilli  O
Paste  O
and  O
Garlic  O
Chips  O
placed  O
on  O
the  O

The  O
waiter/waitress  O
also  O
brought  O
a  O
jar  O
of  O
free  O
flow  O
Stir-fried  O
Chilli  O
Chives  O
.  O

TheChilli  O
Chives  O
did  O
not  O
look  O
appealing  O
so  O
I  O
only  O
took  O
some  O
to  O
try  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
said  O
the  O
taste  O
was  O
very  O
subjective  O
.  O

Chives  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Yaki  O

which  O
was  O

beautifully  O
.  O

It  O
had  O

I  O
am  O
always  O
quite  O
sceptical  O
of  O
Ramen  O
restaurants  O
as  O
they  O
always  O
turned  O
out  O
with  O
disappointment  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
surprised  O
that  O
RamenPlay  O
has  O
pretty  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
Ramen  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Sanpou  O

that  O
comes  O
with  O
braised  O
pork  O

,  O
pork  O

and  O

.  O

The  O
highlight  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
broth  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
thick  O
,  O
flavourful  O
and  O
delicious  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
left  O
a  O

my  O

Mutton  O

probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
Mutton  O

in  O

.  O

It  O
was  O
full  O
of  O
rich  O
spicy  O
flavour  O
and  O
not  O
oily  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
chunks  O
of  O
tender  O
mutton  O
.  O

I  O

have  O

to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O

I  O
like  O
to  O
eat  O
the  O
bread  O
after  O
soaking  O
up  O
the  O
delicious  O
broth  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
adventurous  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
sheep  O

The  O
Lamp  O
Chop  O
was  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
bland  O
and  O
sides  O
were  O
boring  O
.  O

3.5/5  O

However  O
the  O
Chilean  O
Mussels  O
were  O
excellent  O
.  O

The  O
creamy  O

was  O
a  O
perfect  O
match  O
for  O
the  O

Japanese  O
food  O
.  O

This  O
homely  O
restaurant  O
at  O
Casuarina  O
Road  O
has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
10  O
years  O
.  O

I  O
used  O
to  O
frequent  O
this  O
humble  O
establishment  O
when  O
I  O
was  O
working  O
at  O
Sembawang  O
Airbase  O
.  O

The  O
Tonkatsu  O
Curry  O
was  O
nothing  O
to  O
wow  O
about  O
but  O
definitely  O
gave  O
a  O
home  O
cooked  O
feel  O
.  O

The  O
Tonkatsu  O
was  O
interestingly  O
sliced  O
but  O
in  O
a  O
pathetic  O
way  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
Tonkatsu  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

a  O
verytasty  O
and  O
rich  O

I  O
was  O
delighted  O
that  O
Jacob  O
chose  O
to  O
give  O
the  O
soup  O
a  O
chunky  O
texture  O
.  O

Each  O
spoonful  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
biting  O
into  O
the  O
chewy  O
bits  O
of  O
the  O
mushrooms  O

The  O
Main  O
was  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
.  O

Confit  O
is  O
prepared  O
through  O
a  O
tedious  O
process  O
of  O
preservation  O
that  O
consists  O
of  O
salt  O
curing  O
and  O
poaching  O
in  O
its  O
own  O
fat  O
.  O

Jacob  O
has  O
spent  O
a  O
week  O
preparing  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Jacob  O
was  O
very  O
nervous  O
when  O
the  O
main  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

He  O
kept  O
asking  O
us  O
how  O
was  O
the  O
duck  O
confit  O
but  O
in  O
return  O
was  O
only  O
silent  O
.  O

In  O
actual  O
fact  O
we  O
were  O
lost  O
of  O
words  O
,  O
deeply  O
impressed  O
and  O
overwhelmed  O
by  O
Jacob  O
's  O
culinary  O
skill  O

Beef  O
noodle  O
basically  O
has  O
two  O
versions  O
,  O
dry  O
and  O

I  O
used  O

love  O
the  O
dry  O
version  O
when  O
I  O
was  O
in  O
my  O
teens  O

now  O
I  O
prefer  O
the  O

version  O

Penangfood  O
always  O
has  O
a  O
place  O
in  O
Singaporean  O
tummy  O
.  O

I  O
guess  O
this  O
is  O
because  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
similarity  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
such  O
as  O
Laksa  O
,  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
,  O
Prawn  O
Noodle  O
and  O
etc  O
but  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
of  O
Penang  O
flavour  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
a  O
few  O
reviews  O
on  O
Penang  O
Road  O
Cafe  O
,  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
at  O
Novena  O

.  O

The  O
cafe  O
has  O
a  O
simple  O

and  O
the  O

such  O
as  O

,  O
Assam  O
Laksa  O
,  O
Prawn  O
Noodle  O
and  O
Lor  O
Bak  O
.  O

The  O
Assam  O
Laksa  O
was  O
pretty  O
decent  O
however  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
soup  O
was  O
not  O
robust  O
enough  O
.  O

It  O
lacked  O
the  O
strong  O
sour  O
flavour  O
from  O
the  O
tamarind  O
.  O

A  O
bit  O
more  O
of  O
the  O

fish  O
would  O
also  O
be  O
preferred  O

What  O
got  O
me  O
more  O
excited  O
is  O
the  O

from  O
the  O
popular  O

at  O
the  O

It  O
definitely  O
gave  O
me  O
the  O
assurance  O
these  O
guys  O
are  O
not  O
new  O
kids  O
on  O
the  O
block  O
.  O

Being  O
located  O
at  O
a  O
coffeeshop  O
,  O
their  O
extensive  O

are  O
very  O
reasonable  O
and  O

The  O
Xiang  O

Fen  O
or  O
Crispy  O
Fried  O
Noodle  O
is  O
a  O
popular  O
noodle  O
dish  O
in  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
was  O
first  O
deep  O
fried  O
and  O
served  O
over  O
a  O
gravy  O
full  O
of  O
seafood  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
the  O
noodle  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
how  O
big  O
the  O
serving  O
was  O
and  O
it  O
costs  O
only  O
$  O
3  O
!  O

The  O
dish  O
is  O
not  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
so  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
ask  O
the  O

a  O
surprise  O
to  O

.  O

It  O
was  O
soft  O

with  O
a  O
bit  O

taste  O
.  O

Usually  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
find  O
it  O
at  O

as  O
it  O
takes  O
long  O
hours  O
to  O

I  O
still  O
could  O
not  O
figure  O
out  O
why  O
it  O
is  O
called  O

but  O
itwasreally  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

A  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
to  O
eat  O
eggplant  O
because  O
it  O
turns  O
mushy  O
when  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
not  O

I  O
visited  O
the  O

intending  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Shantou  O
Shi  O
Teochew  O

but  O
was  O
surprised  O
that  O
it  O
has  O
changed  O
to  O
Tian  O

Tian  O
Fishhead  O
Steamboat  O
.  O

Is  O
this  O
the  O
popular  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
?  O

When  O
have  O
they  O
taken  O
over  O
and  O
have  O
another  O
branch  O
in  O
Kovan  O
?  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
happy  O
to  O
be  O
trying  O
out  O
another  O
popular  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
more  O
spacious  O
here  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O
branch  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
.  O

The  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
here  O
uses  O
charcoal  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
base  O
was  O
very  O
rich  O
in  O
flavor  O
but  O
my  O
partner  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
that  O
the  O

size  O
were  O
all  O
the  O
same  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O

depending  O
on  O
the  O
portion  O
you  O
order  O
.  O

Having  O
the  O

Steamboat  O
alone  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
boring  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O

.  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
nice  O

I  O
actually  O
found  O
prawns  O
inside  O
the  O

unlike  O
most  O
places  O

they  O
always  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
why  O
it  O
is  O
called  O
Prawn  O

I  O
could  O

find  O
any  O

The  O
O'Coffee  O
Club  O
or  O
commonly  O
known  O
as  O
Coffee  O
Club  O
has  O
a  O
branch  O
at  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
Terminal  O

The  O
cafe  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
the  O
arrival  O
hall  O
having  O
a  O
cozy  O

great  O

O'Coffee  O
Club  O
was  O
having  O
1  O
for  O
1  O
promotion  O
so  O
my  O
colleagues  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
terminal  O
3  O
for  O
lunch  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Black  O
Pepper  O

Linguine  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
tender  O
slices  O
of  O
smoked  O
black  O
pepper  O
duck  O

,  O
arranged  O
over  O
a  O

of  O
linguine  O
topped  O
with  O
gruyere  O

and  O
black  O

.  O

The  O
cream  O

was  O
really  O
``  O

felt  O
cheated  O
as  O
the  O

was  O

A  O
great  O
thank  O
you  O
to  O
Charles  O
and  O
Charlene  O
for  O
organising  O
August  O
monthly  O
makam  O
gathering  O
.  O

We  O
visited  O
Xu  O
Jun  O
Sheng  O
at  O
Joo  O
Jiat  O
Road  O
for  O
its  O
traditional  O
Teochew  O
cuisine  O
and  O
porridge  O
.  O

This  O
place  O
has  O
60  O
years  O
of  O
history  O
and  O
has  O
moved  O
from  O
its  O
previous  O
locationfrom  O
50  O
JooChiat  O
Road  O
to  O
121  O
JooChiat  O
Road  O
.  O

Unlike  O
most  O
Teochew  O
Porridge  O
places  O
whereby  O
you  O
ordered  O
from  O
the  O
row  O
of  O
cooked  O
food  O
,  O
you  O
are  O
given  O
a  O
pencil  O
to  O
indicate  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
what  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
order  O
.  O

ThePrawn  O
Rollswere  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
eaten  O
.  O

I  O
googled  O
and  O
read  O
that  O
they  O
used  O
pork  O
mesentary  O
to  O
wrap  O
the  O
fillings  O
.  O

Maybe  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
secret  O
of  O
the  O
crispy  O
outer  O
layer  O
.  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
were  O
also  O
sliced  O
thinner  O
but  O
bigger  O
in  O
diameter  O
which  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
other  O
places  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
great  O
fan  O
for  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
this  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

not  O

We  O
noticed  O
a  O
lot  O
peopleeating  O
this  O
particular  O
steamed  O
fish  O
which  O
had  O
its  O
stomach  O
split  O
out  O
into  O
half  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
very  O
curious  O
and  O
asked  O
the  O
server  O
to  O
order  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Mullet  O
prepared  O
without  O
any  O
seasoning  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
fresh  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

It  O
does  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
fishy  O
smell  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Mullet4/5  O

Teochew  O
cuisine  O
is  O
known  O
for  O
its  O
braised  O
stuff  O
so  O
how  O
can  O
we  O
not  O
try  O
it  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
both  O
the  O
Braised  O
Platter  O
and  O
Pig  O
Trotters  O
.  O

The  O
Braised  O
Platter  O
had  O
both  O
big  O
and  O
small  O
pig  O
intestines  O
,  O
beancurds  O
and  O
fried  O
beancurd  O
skins  O
.  O

The  O
innards  O
,  O
beancurds  O
and  O
fried  O
beancurd  O
skins  O
were  O
well  O
braised  O
soaking  O
up  O
the  O
soy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Braised  O
Platter  O
4/5  O

The  O
Pig  O
Trotters  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
andmelts  O
in  O
the  O
mouth.I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
that  O
most  O
of  O
it  O
was  O
lean  O
meat  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
I  O
took  O
the  O
one  O
and  O
only  O
fatty  O
piece  O
.  O

While  O
writing  O
this  O
post  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
the  O
menu  O
allows  O
us  O
to  O
indicate  O
either  O
tendon  O
or  O
thigh  O
for  O
the  O
Pig  O
Trotters  O
which  O
we  O
left  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

Maybe  O
that  O
was  O
the  O
reason  O
they  O
have  O
given  O
us  O
mostly  O
lean  O
meat  O
.  O

tobe  O
everyone  O
's  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
prawns  O
were  O
big  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

The  O
beancurds  O
were  O
smooth  O
and  O
silky  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
was  O
the  O
highlight  O
that  O
made  O
this  O
dish  O
so  O
tasty  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
I  O
could  O
n't  O
resisttaking  O
a  O
few  O
spoonful  O
of  O
it  O
even  O
though  O
we  O

about  O

As  O
the  O

at  O

my  O

During  O

I  O
got  O
to  O
eat  O
Indian  O

I  O
ordered  O

I  O
was  O
puzzled  O

the  O

whereby  O
it  O
came  O
with  O

It  O
was  O

by  O

so  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

The  O
roast  O
porkwas  O
big  O
and  O
juicy  O
with  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

Today  O
I  O
am  O
going  O
to  O
introduce  O
you  O
to  O
their  O
new  O
menu  O
,  O
COOL  O
NOODLE  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
first  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Anewconcept  O
ofeating  O
noodles  O
in  O
a  O
healthyand  O
cool  O
refreshingway.There  O
are  O
5  O
types  O
of  O
Cool  O
Noodle  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
at  O
$  O
4.80  O
per  O
plate  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
named  O
as  O
Dolphin  O
,  O
Polar  O
Bear  O
,  O
Penguin  O
,  O
Seal  O
and  O
Reindeer  O
.  O

The  O
Seal  O
Cool  O
Noodle  O
comes  O
with  O
white  O
noodles  O
in  O
roasted  O
sesame  O
sauce  O
with  O
sauteed  O
pork  O
,  O
tofu  O
,  O
carrot  O
and  O
cucumber  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
scepticalhow  O
by  O
simply  O
putting  O
some  O
salad  O
and  O
cold  O
noodle  O
together  O
can  O
makea  O
tasty  O
noodle  O
dish  O
.  O

After  O
tasting  O
it  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
applaud  O
the  O
concept  O
and  O
the  O
roasted  O
sesame  O
sauce  O
really  O
brought  O
the  O
dish  O
together  O
.  O

The  O
show  O
Timeless  O
Treats  O
(  O
)  O
had  O
brought  O
to  O
my  O
attention  O
this  O
traditional  O
steamboat  O
place  O
hidden  O
at  O
the  O
basement  O
of  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Tower  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
challenging  O
locating  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
to  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Complex  O
initially  O
and  O
could  O
n't  O
find  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
seek  O
a  O
shopkeeper  O
's  O
help  O
in  O
direction  O
and  O
she  O
directed  O
me  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Actually  O
Thien  O
Kee  O
Steamboat  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Tower  O
another  O
building  O
beside  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Complex  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
linked  O
by  O
a  O
basement  O
walkway  O
which  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
walk  O
pass  O
some  O
discotheque  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
was  O
already  O
crowded  O
with  O
people  O
when  O
I  O
reached  O
there  O
around  O
6pm  O
.  O

Ordering  O
is  O
pretty  O
simple  O
as  O
the  O
steamboat  O
set  O
is  O
standard  O
.  O

Basically  O
you  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
provide3  O
details  O
to  O
the  O
waiter/waitress  O
,  O
number  O
of  O
people  O
,  O
whether  O
you  O
eat  O
beef  O
and  O
you  O
want  O
boiled  O
white  O
chicken  O
.  O

The  O
ingredients  O
for  O
the  O
steamboat  O
were  O
fresh  O
but  O
portion  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
tender  O
but  O
not  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
quality  O
.  O

For  O
people  O
who  O
are  O
used  O
to  O
flavored  O
soup  O
based  O
may  O
find  O
the  O
traditional  O
steamboat  O
soup  O
base  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
bland  O
for  O
their  O
liking  O
.  O

Marble  O
Slab  O
Creameryoriginated  O
from  O
Houston  O
,  O
Texas  O
in  O
1983  O
.  O

Although  O
it  O
does  O
not  O
offer  O
exotic  O

ice  O

flavours  O
such  O
as  O
D24  O

and  O

freshly  O
made  O
daily  O
in  O
small  O
batches  O
in  O

What  O
makes  O
Marble  O

Creamery  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
other  O
ice  O
cream  O
shops  O
is  O
their  O
Mixins  O
or  O
Mix-in  O
.  O

Basically  O
they  O
are  O
toppings  O
but  O
are  O
n't  O
toppings  O
because  O
they  O
get  O
mixed  O
into  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

After  O
selecting  O
your  O
toppings  O
,  O
thestaff  O
will  O
flatten  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
on  O
the  O

and  O
mix  O
them  O
into  O

Second  O

in  O

more  O
BBQ  O
again  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
beautiful  O
pieces  O
of  O
pork  O
,  O
how  O
can  O
I  O
resist  O
it  O
?  O

BBQ  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
also  O
marinated  O
beautifully  O
and  O
it  O
was  O

I  O
wasin  O
Seoul  O
for  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
days  O
for  O
work  O
.  O

My  O
first  O
meal  O
in  O
Seoul  O
was  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
I  O
was  O
amazed  O
by  O
the  O
extendable  O
chimney  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
pork  O
from  O
the  O
Jeju  O
Black  O
Pig  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
!  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
taste  O
fatty  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

Eating  O
BBQ  O
pork  O
the  O
Korean  O
way  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
put  O
the  O
BBQ  O
porkand  O

onto  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
vegetable  O
,  O
wrapped  O
them  O
up  O
together  O
and  O
eat  O
it  O
.  O

After  O
all  O
the  O
BBQ  O
stuff  O
,  O
this  O
bowl  O
of  O
iced  O
cold  O
seaweed  O
soup  O
was  O
very  O
refreshing  O
.  O

In  O
Korea  O
,  O
how  O
can  O
a  O
meal  O
go  O
without  O
alcohol  O
?  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
Korean  O
rice  O
wine  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Makgeolli  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
like  O
beer  O
but  O
sweeter  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
gassy  O
.  O


I  O
was  O
at  O
Vivocity  O
Food  O
Republic  O
for  O
dinner  O
and  O
the  O
place  O
was  O
crowded  O
with  O
diners  O
.  O

To  O
avoid  O
the  O
crowd  O
,  O
I  O
ended  O
up  O
at  O
Pu  O
Tien  O
for  O
dinner  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
easy  O
all  O

For  O
the  O
main  O
,  O
I  O
chose  O
my  O
favourite  O
Pu  O
Tien  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
to  O
call  O
it  O
White  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
those  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
we  O
get  O
from  O
food  O
centres  O
which  O
is  O

I  O
also  O

the  O

at  O

Although  O
Sweet  O

is  O
a  O
common  O
dish  O
,  O
not  O
many  O
restaurant  O
can  O
do  O
it  O
well  O
.  O

Personally  O
I  O
find  O

Wang  O
Lao  O
Wu  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
name  O
in  O
the  O
food  O
scene  O
selling  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

Within  O
3  O
months  O
,  O
the  O
group  O
has  O
already  O
opened  O
5  O
outlets  O
around  O
Singapore  O
.  O

They  O
even  O
give  O
out  O
150  O
free  O
packets  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
to  O
the  O
needy  O
senior  O
citizen  O
in  O
Singapore  O
on  O
every  O
1st  O
and  O
15th  O
of  O
the  O
month  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
that  O
the  O
catchy  O
name  O
Wang  O
Lao  O
Wu  O
(  O
)  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
and  O
not  O
the  O
food  O
initially  O
.  O

After  O
studying  O
the  O
posters  O
placed  O
around  O
the  O
outlet  O
,  O
it  O
kinda  O
of  O
convinced  O
me  O
to  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
try  O
.  O

The  O
pricing  O
at  O
Wang  O
Lao  O
Wu  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
quite  O
reasonable  O
.  O

$  O
4.90  O
for  O
a  O
chicken  O
set  O
meal  O
and  O
$  O
3.80  O
for  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
boiled  O
white  O
chicken  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
still  O
came  O
short  O
to  O
more  O
established  O
chicken  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
have  O
Suan  O

(  O

during  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
Chinese  O
New  O
Year  O
visit  O
prepared  O
by  O
my  O
friend  O
's  O
parent  O
.  O

Since  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
able  O
to  O
find  O
the  O

in  O
eateries  O
around  O
Singapore  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
read  O
about  O
this  O
Hakka  O
stall  O
at  O
Shunfu  O

that  O
sells  O
traditional  O
Hakka  O
food  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
excited  O
and  O
made  O
my  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
centre  O
one  O
morning  O
.  O

A  O
queue  O
was  O
formed  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
when  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
food  O
centre  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
sells  O
a  O

of  O

After  O
a  O
two  O
month  O
's  O
wait  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
so  O
excitedto  O
know  O
that  O
Penang  O
Place  O
Restaurant  O
will  O
reopen  O
at  O
its  O
new  O

at  O

After  O
being  O
introduced  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
located  O
at  O
International  O
Business  O
Park  O
,  O
whenever  O
I  O
have  O
craving  O
for  O
Penang  O
cuisine  O
,  O
Penang  O
Place  O
Restaurant  O
always  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
come  O
to  O
my  O
mind  O
.  O

Our  O
July  O
's  O
foodies  O
and  O
twitter  O
friends  O
gathering  O
was  O
coming  O
up  O
so  O
I  O
suggested  O
the  O
Penang  O
Place  O
Restaurant  O
since  O
most  O
of  O
them  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
also  O
a  O
bit  O
nervous  O
whether  O
the  O
food  O
will  O
be  O
up  O
to  O
their  O
mark  O
.  O

The  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
is  O
verypopular  O
here  O
.  O

Being  O
been  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
I  O
know  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
will  O
disappear  O
from  O
the  O
buffet  O
linein  O
an  O
instant.When  O
I  O
walked  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Istole  O
a  O
glance  O
at  O
the  O
buffet  O
line  O
and  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
's  O
trap  O
was  O
empty  O
!  O

Lucky  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
big  O
group  O
and  O
we  O
can  O
take  O
turns  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
buffet  O
line  O
for  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
delighted  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
was  O
still  O
as  O
good.I  O
also  O
breathed  O
a  O
sigh  O
of  O
relief  O
when  O
the  O
group  O
commented  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
stirred  O
fried  O
with  O
bean  O
sprouts  O
,  O
cockles  O
,  O
prawns  O
,  O
fish  O
cakes  O
and  O
eggs  O
also  O
had  O
the  O
wok  O
smell  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
delicious  O
food  O
thereis  O
alsoan  O
element  O
of  O
fun  O
where  O
one  O
can  O
DIY  O
what  O

want  O
to  O
eat  O
such  O
as  O

located  O
along  O
the  O

MRT  O
line  O
from  O
where  O
I  O
staybut  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
there  O
.  O

Hence  O
Itook  O
the  O
train  O
and  O
went  O
down  O
to  O
explore  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
thiseatinghouseopposite  O
the  O
Indian  O
temple  O
which  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
diners  O
.  O

Most  O

were  O
having  O

I  O
have  O

I  O
did  O

The  O

n't  O
be  O

I  O
settled  O

The  O

was  O
chopped  O
into  O
small  O
pieces  O
and  O
absorbed  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O

also  O

Kids  O
eating  O
this  O

have  O
to  O

careful  O
because  O
it  O

never  O

wanted  O
to  O
trywas  O
the  O
Deep  O

on  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
breaded  O

was  O
crispy  O
and  O
nice  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
probably  O
dried  O
up  O
the  O
century  O
egg  O
and  O
became  O
rubbery  O
,  O
losing  O
that  O
distinct  O
century  O
egg  O
taste  O
.  O

the  O

this  O

will  O

are  O
very  O
popular  O
and  O
well  O

but  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
at  O
the  O
Worker  O
Party  O
's  O
rally  O
at  O
Bedok  O
Stadium  O
for  O
the  O
East  O

GRC  O
and  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
stalls  O
for  O
supper  O
since  O
I  O
was  O
nearby  O
.  O

It  O
took  O
me  O
quite  O
a  O
while  O
to  O
decide  O
which  O
Bak  O
Chor  O
Mee  O
stall  O
to  O
patron  O
.  O

Both  O
stallsare  O
side  O
by  O
side  O
and  O
had  O
long  O
queues.I  O
decided  O
on  O
Xing  O

because  O
of  O
the  O
3  O
letters  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
wait  O
45  O
minutes  O
for  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O
Bak  O

!  O

The  O
stall  O
only  O
sells  O
the  O
soup  O
version  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
minced  O
meat  O
,  O
meat  O
balls  O
and  O
cut  O

The  O
noodles  O
were  O
Q  O

The  O
meatballs  O
werefirmand  O
nice  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O

good  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
disappointmentwas  O
the  O
minced  O
meat  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
it  O
too  O
fine  O
and  O
could  O
not  O
taste  O
them  O
in  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
having  O
the  O
cut  O
red  O
chilli  O
with  O
the  O
noodles  O
and  O
asked  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
the  O
stall  O
owner  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
happy  O
thatI  O
asked  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
what  O
was  O
given  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
lady  O
I  O
approached  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
was  O
very  O
nice  O
and  O
asked  O
me  O
to  O
help  O
myself  O
to  O
them  O

It  O

We  O
only  O
wished  O
that  O
there  O
were  O
more  O

as  O
the  O

quite  O

with  O

The  O
mashed  O
potato  O
was  O
smooth  O
and  O
good  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
was  O
too  O
salty  O

Since  O
it  O

the  O

I  O
was  O
wondering  O
around  O
Albert  O
Centre  O
Food  O
Centre  O
thinking  O
what  O
to  O
eat  O
for  O
dinner  O
and  O
I  O
noticed  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
having  O
congee  O
that  O
was  O
served  O
instyrofoam  O
bowl  O
.  O

I  O
started  O
looking  O
for  O
the  O
stall  O
and  O
foundit  O
tucked  O
at  O
a  O
corner  O
with  O
a  O
long  O
queue  O
.  O

I  O
looked  O
up  O
the  O
web  O
and  O
I  O
realized  O
that  O
Li  O
Fang  O
Zhou  O
Pin  O
(  O
)  O
has  O
several  O
branches  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
stall  O
at  O
ABC  O
Brickworks  O
Food  O
Centre  O
and  O
another  O
at  O
Yuhua  O
Market  O
and  O
Hawker  O
Centre  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
able  O
to  O
verify  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
original  O
stall  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
wise  O
idea  O
to  O
serve  O
instyrofoam  O
bowl.What  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
understand  O
is  O
for  O
takeaway  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
used  O
plastic  O
bowl  O
instead  O
for  O
an  O
additional  O
20  O
cents  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Congee  O
in  O
Boat  O
Style  O
which  O
is  O
basically  O
congess  O
with  O
sliced  O
fish  O
,  O
cuttlefish  O
,  O
chives  O
and  O
peanuts  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
was  O
smoothy  O
and  O
not  O
watery  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
Youtiao  O
(  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
crisp  O
and  O
warm  O
,  O
giving  O
a  O
final  O
toast  O
on  O
the  O
grill  O
before  O
serving  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
years  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
comes  O
in  O
two  O
sections  O
.  O

One  O
section  O
for  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
for  O
Ala  O
Carte  O
.  O

My  O
friendsopted  O
for  O
the  O
ala  O
carte  O
and  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
first  O
servicing  O
came  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
feeling  O
disappointed  O
that  O
thevarieties  O
ofside  O
dishes  O
in  O
Korean  O
cuisinehave  O
shrunk  O
to  O
just  O
3  O
small  O
portions  O
on  O
a  O
single  O
plate  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
that  O
the  O
restaurant  O
served  O
some  O
sort  O
of  O
Amus  O
Bouche  O
which  O
was  O
unexpected  O
for  O
a  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
potato  O
salad  O
,  O
anchovies  O
(  O
Ikan  O
Bilis  O
)  O
and  O
black  O
peas  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
potato  O
salad  O
and  O
anchovies  O
were  O
ok  O
but  O
nothing  O
Korean  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
beans  O
were  O
hard  O
which  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
really  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

Now  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
part  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
spread  O
of  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
pancakes  O
were  O
a  O
bit  O
tasteless  O
to  O
me  O
butthey  O
werenice  O
and  O
not  O
too  O
floury  O
.  O

Ginseng  O
Chicken  O
which  O
is  O
known  O
as  O
Samgyetang  O
in  O
Korean  O
is  O
a  O
summer  O
dish  O
that  O
consists  O
of  O
a  O
whole  O
chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
andcooked  O
inKorean  O
ginseng  O
broth.At  O
first  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
the  O
soup  O
will  O
be  O
too  O
heavy  O
with  O
ginseng  O
flavour  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
not  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
also  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
Mackerel  O
cooked  O
in  O
Korean  O
style  O
and  O
I  O
love  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
I  O
ate  O
three  O
quarter  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
alone  O
.  O

However  O
this  O
dish  O
is  O
not  O
suitable  O
for  O
children  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
fish  O
bones  O
and  O
care  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
taken  O
eating  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
Bulgogi  O
Pork  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
in  O
portion  O
and  O
tiny  O
sliced.It  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
lettuce  O

you  O
can  O
wrap  O
the  O
meat  O
with  O
the  O
lettuce  O
andeat  O
it  O
as  O
a  O
whole  O
.  O

The  O
lettuce  O
gave  O
the  O
dish  O
a  O
freshening  O
texture  O
and  O
balanced  O
the  O
oiliness  O
of  O
the  O
meat  O

I  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Bruschette  O

for  O
the  O

The  O
Ciccioli  O
had  O
a  O
taste  O
of  O
saltiness  O
(  O
properly  O
from  O
the  O
aging  O
)  O
when  O
eaten  O
