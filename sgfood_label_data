Onion  B-F

Mushroom  I-F
Omelette  I-F
3/5  O
I  O
was  O
craving  O
for  O
egg  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Onion  I-F
Cheese  I-F
Mushroom  I-F
Omelette  I-F
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
omelette  O
was  O
nothing  O
fancy  O
just  O
homely  O
cooked  O
food  O
that  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

Maybe  O
I  O
was  O
unfortunate  O
cause  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
find  O
any  O
mushroom  O
in  O
my  O
omelette  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
as  O
cheesy  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
have  O
like  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
of  O
Signature  B-ORG
Stone  I-ORG
Restaurant  I-ORG
is  O
their  O
version  O
of  O
claypot  O
rice  O
using  O
stone  O
pot  O
.  O

To  O
suit  O
the  O
palate  O
of  O
the  O
younger  O
generation  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
introduced  O
a  O
western  O
version  O
of  O
claypot  O
rice  O
such  O
as  O
Stone  B-F
Pot  I-F
Ham  I-F
&  I-F
Cheese  I-F
Rice  I-F
,  O
Stone  B-F
Pot  I-F
Lemony  I-F
Scallop  I-F
and  O
many  O
more  O
.  O

The  O
stone  O
pot  O
serving  O
is  O
for  O
individual  O
portion  O
.  O

Upon  O
serving  O
,  O
the  O
server  O
will  O
drizzle  O
some  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
over  O
the  O
rice  O
and  O
fold  O
it  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
prefer  O
your  O
rice  O
to  O
be  O
darker  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Stone  B-F

Garlic  I-F

Salmon  I-F
4.2/5  O
For  O
the  O
western  O
flavour  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Stone  B-F
Pot  I-F
Garlic  I-F
Herb  I-F
Salmon  I-F
(  O
$  O
12.30  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
choice  O
with  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
garlic  O
instantly  O
hit  O
the  O
nostrils  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
an  O
advantage  O
of  O
using  O
stone  O
pot  O
over  O
claypot  O
cause  O
you  O
get  O
layers  O
after  O
layers  O
of  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
rice  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

The  O
first  O
fold  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
brings  O
the  O
burnt  O
rice  O
to  O
the  O
top  O
.  O

While  O
eating  O
the  O
top  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
is  O
still  O
cooking  O
the  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
.  O

Hence  O
when  O
we  O
fold  O
again  O
,  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
enjoy  O
another  O
layer  O
of  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
rice  O
.  O

Stone  B-F

Fish  I-F
4/5  O
For  O
a  O
taste  O
of  O
tradition  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Stone  I-F
Pot  I-F
Sliced  I-F
Pork  I-F
with  I-F
Salted  I-F
Fish  I-F
(  O
$  O
8.20  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
sliced  O
pork  O
,  O
chinese  O
sausages  O
,  O
mushroom  O
and  O
salted  O
fish  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
beside  O
the  O
salted  O
fish  O
in  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
,  O
it  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
separate  O
saucer  O
with  O
finely  O
diced  O
salted  O
fish  O
to  O
be  O
pour  O
and  O
mixed  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
so  O
each  O
mouthful  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
good  O
blend  O
of  O
salted  O
fish  O
,  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
rice  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
Signature  B-ORG
Stone  I-ORG
Restaurant  I-ORG
.  O

However  O
for  O
an  O
individual  O
stone  O
pot  O
serving  O
portion  O
,  O
I  O
think  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
pricey O
. O

Probably  O
they  O
can  O
provide  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
ingredients  O
for  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
so  O
that  O
it  O
gives  O
the  O
customer  O
an  O
impression  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
getting  O
value  O
in  O
return  O
.  O

respected  O
as  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
introduce  O
Singapore  O
to  O
authentic  O
sushi  O
.  O

Considered  O
the  O
forefather  O
of  O
sushi  O
in  O
Singapore  O
and  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
top  O
chefs  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
Li-san  O
is  O
a  O
ryori-jin  O
(  O
masterchef  O
)  O
specialising  O
in  O
Kappo  O
Ryori  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
fine  O
Omakase  O
.  O

From  O
sushi  O
to  O
grilling  O
,  O
stewing  O
and  O
boiling  O
,  O
Chef  O
Li-san  O
has  O
mastered  O
and  O
conquered  O
all  O
aspects  O
of  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Zensai  B-F
4/5  O
We  O
started  O
the  O
meal  O
with  O
a  O
trio  O
of  O
Zensai  B-F
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
Japanese  O
for  O
hors  O
d'oeuvre  O
.  O

Starting  O
with  O
the  O
Shiraou  B-F
(  O
silver  O
fish  O
)  O
in  O
a  O
shoyu  O
sauce  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
how  O
it  O
was  O
presented  O
in  O
a  O
short  O
glass  O
.  O

The  O
shiraou  O
was  O
rather  O
fat  O
and  O
beautifully  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
flavourful  O
shoyu  O
sauce  O
.  O

Moving  O
on  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Oyster  B-F
in  I-F
Mayonnaise  I-F
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
smoky  O
torched  O
mayonnaise  O
taste  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
too  O
overpowering  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
oyster  O
.  O

Lastly  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
Pitan  B-F
Tofu  I-F
which  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
all  O
time  O
favourites  O
in  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

While  O
century  O
egg  O
maybe  O
an  O
acquire  O
taste  O
for  O
some  O
,  O
I  O
simply  O
adored  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
creamy  O
century  O
egg  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
chilled  O
tofu  O
.  O

Sashimi  B-F
4/5  O
The  O
plate  O
of  O
Sashimi  B-F
(  O
$  O
55  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
freshest  O
Hamachi  O
,  O
Salmon  O
,  O
Toro  O
Belly  O
and  O
Botan  O
Ebi  O
for  O
the  O
day  O
.  O

The  O
Botan  O
Ebi  O
stood  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
with  O
its  O
sweetness  O
and  O
freshness  O
.  O

Zakana  B-F
Foie  I-F
Gras  I-F
4.2/5  O
The  O
Zakana  I-F
Foie  I-F
Gras  I-F
(  O
$  O
25  O
)  O
was  O
an  O
exquisite  O
execution  O
from  O
Chef  O
Li-san  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
Hamachi  O
is  O
wrapped  O
with  O
foie  O
gras  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
shaved  O
truffle  O
and  O
seaweed  O
covered  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
sheet  O
of  O
crunchy  O
seaweed  O
and  O
plated  O
on  O
a  O
sakura  O
leaf  O
.  O

Amazingly  O
everything  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
is  O
edible  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
dish  O
is  O
rather  O
oily  O
,  O
the  O
sakaru  O
leaf  O
helped  O
to  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Imo  B-F
Manjyu  I-F
3.5/5  O
Deep  O
fried  O

)  O
is  O

the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
delectable  O
mixture  O
of  O
yam  O
,  O
unagi  O
and  O
shrimp  O
came  O
with  O
nice  O
chunky  O
yam  O
bits  O
finished  O
with  O

Kamut  O
is  O
not  O
the  O
name  O
of  O
the  O

but  O
a  O
trademark  O

was  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
molten  O
lava  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
rather  O
than  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
accompanying  O
spicy  O
vanilla  O

cream  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
,  O
creamy  O

with  O
a  O
nice  O
tad  O
of  O

it  O
fell  O
just  O
short  O
for  O
me  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
liqueur  O
content  O
was  O
a  O

It  O
shadowed  O
the  O

I  O
was  O
expecting  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
that  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O

to  O
order  O
so  O
I  O
just  O
went  O
to  O

ordered  O
from  O
there  O

choice  O
of  O
butter  O
chicken  O
or  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
but  O
I  O
order  O
another  O
serving  O
of  O
mutton  O
masala  O
.  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
resist  O
ordering  O
the  O
mutton  O
masala  O
after  O
noticing  O
the  O
next  O
table  O
having  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
was  O
too  O
dry  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
naan  O
,  O
mutton  O
masala  O
is  O
better  O
option  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
did  O
not  O
like  O
the  O
curry  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
cold  O
.  O

Batura  B-F
Set  I-F
Chicken  I-F
3.8/5  O
My  O
partner  O
ordered  O
the  O
Batura  B-F
Chicken  I-F
Set  I-F
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
with  O
butter  O
chicken  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
batura  O
and  O
we  O
were  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
the  O
huge  O
puffed  O
bread  O
made  O
from  O
maida  O
flour  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

We  O
are  O
also  O
surprised  O
that  O
the  O
butter  O
chicken  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
gravy  O
,  O
we  O
thought  O
they  O
have  O
served  O
us  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
instead  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
patrons  O
ordered  O
their  O
curry  O
fish  O
head  O
,  O
I  O
should  O
try  O
to  O
have  O
them  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

The  O
naan  O
is  O
pretty  O
good  O
too  O
but  O
I  O
will  O
prefer  O
the  O
mutton  O
masala  O
to  O
the  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
or  O
butter  O
chicken  O
.  O

Fosters  B-ORG

since  O
1960  O

Steakhouse  I-ORG
was  O
first  O
established  O
at  O
25  O
Amber  O
Mansion  O
of  O
old  O

Moving  O
another  O
2  O
times  O
to  O
Specialists  O
Shopping  O
Centre  O
and  O
Palais  O
Renaissance  O
before  O
settling  O
down  O
at  O
the  O
current  O
venue  O
.  O

Upon  O
settling  O
down  O
,  O
warm  O
breads  O
were  O
served  O
.  O

After  O
browsing  O
through  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O

which  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O

Mushroom  B-F

Soup  I-F
4/5  O
Both  O
the  O
Mushroom  B-F
Soup  I-F
and  O
Onion  B-F
Soup  I-F
were  O
comforting  O
and  O
homely  O
.  O

Compared  O
the  O
two  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
the  O
Onion  B-F
Soup  I-F
which  O
is  O
more  O
flavourful  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
caramelised  O
onion  O
.  O

Fillet  B-F
Steak  I-F
4/5  O
There  O
were  O
5  O
choices  O
for  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Fillet  B-F
Steak  I-F
which  O
was  O
grilled  O
tenderloin  O
served  O
with  O
chestnut  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chestnut  O
sauce  O
sounds  O
interesting  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
not  O
really  O
noticeable  O
.  O

The  O
fillet  O
inself  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O

of  O
beef  O
steak  O
,  O
chicken  O
and  O
salmon  O
fillet  O
served  O
with  O
mushroom  O

was  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
beef  O
and  O
chicken  O
were  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
,  O
the  O
salmon  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
over  O
cooked  O
and  O
dry  O
.  O

Coffee  B-F
The  O
lunch  O
set  O

a  O
choice  O
of  O
Coffee  B-F

We  O
are  O
both  O
coffee  O
drinker  O
so  O
inevitable  O
our  O
choice  O
is  O
not  O
quite  O
difficult  O
.  O

the  O

was  O
Apple  B-F

with  I-F
Vanilla  I-F
Ice  I-F

.  O

A  O
simple  O
sweet  O
ending  O
for  O
lunch  O
.  O

While  O
dining  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O

I  O
noticed  O
there  O
were  O
many  O
awards  O
and  O
write  O
ups  O
being  O
framed  O
and  O
hanged  O
on  O
the  O

its  O
Makansutra  B-ORG
dinner  I-ORG
for  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
July  O
2013  O
.  O

This  O
time  O
the  O

was  O
at  O

its  O
my  O
first  O
Japanese  O
makansutra  O

I  O

we  O
have  O
Karen  O

Philip  O

Pitan  B-F

4.2/5  O
As  O
usual  O
dinner  O
started  O
quite  O
late  O
at  O
8pm  O
.  O

We  O
started  O
the  O
10  O
course  O
meal  O
with  O
Pitan  B-F
Tofu  I-F
.  O

It  O
reminded  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
same  O
dish  O
I  O
had  O
many  O
years  O
ago  O
which  O
brought  O
back  O
many  O
memories  O
.  O

Enhanced  O
by  O
the  O
century  O
egg  O
,  O
the  O
combination  O
was  O
a  O
delightful  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
texture  O
and  O
flavour  O
.  O

Nama  B-F
Kaki  I-F

The  B-F
Fin  I-F
De  I-F
Claire  I-F
Oyster  I-F
with  I-F
Ponzu  I-F

was  O
fresh  O

the  O
delightful  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

Fugu  B-F
Mirin  I-F
Boshi  I-F
4/5  O
When  O
the  O
Fugu  B-F
Mirin  I-F
Boshi  I-F
was  O
served  O
,  O
everyone  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
guess  O
what  O
it  O
is  O
?  O

The  O
taste  O
and  O
texture  O
which  O
resembles  O
the  O
Bak  O
Kwa  O
is  O
actually  O
dried  O
puffer  O
fish  O
seasoned  O
with  O
sweet  O
sake  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
tradtional  O
snack  O
eaten  O
while  O
drinking  O
sake  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
tried  O
the  O
dried  O
puffer  O
fish  O
before  O
in  O
my  O
previous  O
experience  O
at  O
Seki  O
Japanese  O
Restaurant  O
which  O
unfortunately  O
has  O
closed  O
its  O
door  O
.  O

Sashimi  B-F
Moriawase  I-F
4/5  O
The  O
Sashimi  B-F
Moriawase  I-F
was  O
served  O
with  O
6  O
kinds  O
of  O
fresh  O
sashimi  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
assorted  O
sashimi  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
squid  O
with  O
stuffed  O
roe  O
was  O
interesting  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
that  O
came  O
with  O
popping  O
surprises  O
.  O

Tenderloin  B-F
Teppanyaki  I-F
4.5/5  O
The  O
Tenderloin  B-F
Teppanyaki  I-F
was  O
probably  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
Australian  O
beef  O
with  O
homemade  O
apple  O
sauce  O
was  O
pan  O
fried  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
bursting  O
with  O
flavours  O
.  O

Makimono  B-F
Moriawase  I-F
3/5  O
The  O
Makimono  B-F
Moriawase  I-F
was  O
a  O
welcome  O
trio  O
of  O
carbohydrates  O
to  O
satisfy  O
the  O
hungry  O
stomach  O
.  O

Ebi  B-F
Kawari  I-F
Mayonnaise  I-F
Ae  I-F
4.2/5  O
The  O
Ebi  B-F
Kawari  I-F
Maonnaise  I-F
Ae  O
was  O
another  O
lovely  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
marinated  O
prawn  O
fritters  O
was  O
crunchy  O
and  O
coated  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
garlic  O
sauce  O
.  O

Toro  B-F
no  I-F
Foie  I-F
Gras  I-F
Miso  I-F
Yaki  I-F
3.5/5  O
This  O
is  O
the  O
dish  O
that  O
everyone  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
but  O
the  O
Toro  B-F
no  I-F
Foie  I-F
Gras  I-F
Miso  I-F
Yaki  I-F
was  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
excellent  O
individually  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
fatty  O
tuna  O
was  O
overpowered  O
by  O
the  O
strong  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
,  O
duck  O
liver  O
and  O
miso  O
sauce  O
when  O
eaten  O
together  O
.  O

Truffle  B-F
Inaniwa  I-F
Udon  I-F
2.8/5  O
The  O
Truffle B-F
Inaniwa  I-F
Udon  I-F
was  O
an  O
interesting  O
concept  O
but  O
the  O
signature  O
Japanese  O
wheat  O
noodle  O
was  O
totally  O
drown  O
by  O
the  O
black  O
pepper  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
much  O
that  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
even  O
taste  O
the  O
truffle  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
wheat  O
noodle  O
was  O
lumpy  O
and  O
chewy  O
that  O
was  O
not  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
about  O
IndoChili  B-ORG
after  O
reading  O
the  O
good  O
review  O
at  O
Maureen  O

Stepping  O

I  O
like  O
that  O

Tahu  B-F
Telor  I-F
4.2/5  O
Initially  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
n't  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
presentation  O
of  O
the  O
Tahu  B-F
Telor  I-F
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
a  O
beancurd  O
tower  O
instead  O
of  O
pieces  O
of  O
beancurd  O
drenched  O
with  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
.  O

What  O
hit  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
unique  O
savoury  O
sweet  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
Tahu  O
Telor  O
sauce  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
spotted  O
an  O
interesting  O
white  O
ingredient  O
garnished  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
beancurd  O
omelette  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
raw  O
garlic  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
realised  O
it  O
was  O
baby  O
bean  O
sprout  O
head  O
which  O
they  O
painstakingly  O
peeled  O
after  O
checking  O
with  O
the  O
staff  O
.  O

The  O

is  O
a  O
traditional  O
from  O
Minangkabau  O
,  O
West  O
Sumatra  O
.  O

The  O
fork  O
tender  O
beef  O
redang  O
was  O
slow  O
cooked  O
for  O
at  O
least  O
4  O
hours  O
packed  O
with  O
richness  O
of  O
the  O

may  O
not  O

spicy  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Indian  O
version  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
is  O
more  O
watered  O
down  O
with  O
a  O
strong  O
ginger  O
taste  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
actually  O
surprised  O
that  O
coconut  O
milk  O
was  O
added  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

For  O
diners  O
that  O
ca  O
n't  O
take  O
too  O
spicy  O
,  O
the  O
kari  O

will  O
be  O
easy  O
for  O

The  O
thick  O

comforting  O

hearty  O
.  O

No  O

it  O

known  O
for  O
serving  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O

I  O
have  O
learnt  O
from  O
my  O

that  O
you  O
can  O
squeeze  O
a  O

,  O
add  O
a  O
few  O
drops  O
of  O
sweet  O
soy  O

and  O
mix  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
sambal  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
,  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
different  O
punch  O

Not  O
familiar  O

a  O

of  O
people  O

AmaSoy B-ORG
including  O
myself  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
only  O
introduced  O
to  O
it  O
during  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
visit  O
toDARNO  O
Japanese  O
Hotpot  O
by  O
MOF  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
dual  O
meaning  O
to  O
the  O
brand  O
name  O
,  O
Ama  O
means  O
Sweet  O
in  O
Japanese  O
and  O
also  O
Grandma  O
in  O
Chinese  O
.  O

The  O
founder  O
chanced  O
upon  O
this  O
delicious  O
Tounyu  O
Soy  O
Beancurd  O
reminiscent  O
the  O
Singapore  O
soy  O
beancurd  O
during  O
her  O
stay  O
in  O
Japan  O
and  O
the  O
taste  O
reminded  O
her  O
of  O
the  O
memories  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
growing  O
up  O
with  O
her  O
grandma  O
in  O
meager  O
conditions  O
.  O

Let  O
me  O
let  O
you  O
in  O
into  O
something  O
you  O
probably  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
too  O
.  O

AmaSoy  O
beancurd  O
recipe  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
Japanese  O
recipe  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
natural  O
compared  O
to  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
brands  O
that  O
uses  O
coffeemix  O
in  O
the  O
mixture  O
.  O

The  O
natural  O
and  O
nutritious  O
recipe  O
is  O
trans-fat  O
free  O

Recently  O
,  O
AmaSoy  O
has  O
improved  O
in  O
their  O

enhancing  O
the  O
Japanese  O
pudding  O
with  O
Collagen  O
and  O
Omega  O
3  O
(  O

.  O

Besides  O
the  O
popular  O
Original  O
,  O
Almond  O
and  O
Mango  O
beancurd  O
,  O
exciting  O
new  O
flavours  O
and  O

For  O
toppings  O

can  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
new  O
additions  O

as  O
red  O

lotus  O
seeds  O
,  O
aloe  O
vera  O
,  O
taro  O
and  O
strawberry  O
etc  O
.  O

So  O
why  O
do  O
I  O
prefer  O
AmaSoy  O
Japanese  O
pudding  O
or  O
beancurd  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
brand  O
?  O

First  O
of  O
all  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
other  O
brands  O
too  O
sweet  O
to  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

AmaSoy  B-F
beancurd  I-F
is  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
and  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Have  O
you  O
ever  O
left  O
your  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
beancurd  O
overnight  O
and  O
noticed  O
a  O
sheet  O
like  O
layer  O
thingy  O
on  O
the  O
surface  O
?  O

If  O
felt  O
so  O
artificial  O
in  O
what  O
I  O
was  O
consuming  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
texture  O
of  O
Amasoy  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
as  O
smooth  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
brands  O
,  O
the  O
health  O
conscious  O
me  O
prefer  O
the  O
all  O
natural  O
and  O
nutritious  O
recipe  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
,  O
it  O
now  O
comes  O
with  O
collagen  O
and  O
omega  O
3  O
(  O
DHA  O
)  O
.  O

Last  O
but  O
not  O
least  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
beancurd  O
brand  O
that  O
allows  O
one  O
to  O
add  O
toppings  O
of  O
their  O
liking  O
for  O
a  O
wholesome  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
this  O
delectable  O
dessert  O
.  O

My  O

telling  O
about  O
this  O

in  O

quite  O
awesome  O
sambal  O

.  O

Some  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
,  O
we  O
made  O
our  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
far  O

A  O
long  O

at  O

we  O
have  O

The  O
Sambal  B-F
Fish  I-F
Head  I-F
(  O
$  O
10/15/20  O
)  O
is  O
the  O
reason  O
why  O
we  O
have  O
made  O
the  O
journey  O
to  O
the  O
far  O
east  O
.  O

This  O
fiery  O
looking  O
dish  O
packed  O
a  O
punch  O
and  O
will  O
set  O
your  O
mouth  O
on  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
what  O
species  O
of  O
fish  O
the  O
stall  O
used  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

The  O
sambal  O
was  O
definitely  O
the  O
highlight  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O
delectable  O
fish  O
head  O
and  O
bitter  O
gourd  O
.  O

The  O
aroma  O
sambal  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
Hua  O
Tiao  O
wine  O
making  O
it  O
more  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
also  O
popular  O
for  O
its  O
Black  O
Bean  O

Fish  O
Head  O
with  O

The  O

was  O

while  O
I  O
have  O
read  O
good  O
reviews  O
on  O
Prego  B-ORG
at  O

but  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
get  O
the  O
chance  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
food  O
until  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O

With  O
a  O
new  O
look  O
menu  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
dining  O
experience  O
at  O
the  O
Italian  O
Trattoria  O
,  O
Chef  O
Antonio  O
Facchinetti  O

to  O

an  O
authentic  O
,  O
traditional  O
and  O
homely  O
Italian  O
cuisine  O
with  O
the  O
fresh  O
and  O
quality  O
ingredients  O

We  O
started  O
the  O
meal  O
with  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
bread  O
accompanied  O
by  O
seasonal  O
dips  O
.  O

From  O

My  O
personal  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
three  O
is  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onion  O
with  O
ricotta  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
sweet  O
and  O
savoury  O
combination  O
worked  O
wonderfully  O
with  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
lending  O
a  O

bite  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
appreciated  O
the  O
fresh  O
greens  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
zesty  O
lemon  O
dressing  O
to  O
live  O
up  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O

with  O
roasted  O

The  O
pork  O
sausage  O
did  O
resemble  O
the  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
familiar  O
to  O
my  O
Asian  O
palate  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
fatty  O
texture  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
,  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
roasted  O
organic  O
sweet  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
gave  O
the  O
needed  O
balance  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
which  O
I  O
applauded  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
also  O
went  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
bread  O
.  O

dish  O
with  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
dish  O
getting  O
favourable  O
nods  O
from  O
the  O
table  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
like  O
my  O

relax  O
and  O
laze  O
at  O
the  O
alfresco  O

Changi  I-ORG
on  O
a  O
weekend  O
around  O
530pm  O

watching  O

is  O
the  O

,  O
dressed  O
in  O

.  O

Topshell  O
itself  O
is  O
quite  O
bland  O
hence  O
the  O
sauce  O
plays  O
an  O
important  O
part  O
in  O
lifting  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
the  O
spicy  O
tangy  O
sauce  O
definitely  O
did  O
that  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

crunchy  O

,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O

thick  O
to  O
allow  O
me  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
texture  O

it  O
further  O

the  O
whole  O

I  O
actually  O
wanted  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
popular  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
at  O
Clementi  O
Central  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
opened  O
hence  O
I  O
went  O
walked  O
over  O
to  O
Clementi  O
block  O
448  O
Market  O
and  O
Food  O
Centre  O
to  O
have  O
my  O
breakfast  O
instead  O
.  O

After  O
walking  O
around  O
the  O
food  O
centre  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
join  O
the  O
queue  O
at  O
Boon  B-ORG
Kee  I-ORG
Wanton  I-ORG

for  O
my  O
breakfast  O
.  O

Wanton  B-F

and  I-F
Soup  I-F
From  O
my  O
observation  O
,  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
family  O
run  O
stall  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
2  O
old  O
folks  O
that  O
is  O
helping  O
out  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
which  O
I  O
suspect  O
is  O
the  O
parent  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
hearten  O
to  O
see  O
2  O
young  O
gentlemen  O
probably  O
in  O
their  O
mid  O
20  O
to  O
early  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
age  O
running  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

One  O
is  O
at  O
the  O
front  O
,  O
taking  O
orders  O
and  O
payment  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
is  O
inside  O
the  O
stall  O
cooking  O
the  O
noodles  O
.  O

the  O
eggy  O

that  O
has  O
a  O
good  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
was  O
quite  O
average  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
I  O
found  O
the  O
char  O
siew  O
serving  O
was  O
rather  O
pathetic  O
.  O

Wanton  B-F

(  O
$  O
2.50/  O

)  O
fared  O
much  O
better  O
to  O
the  O
dry  O
version  O
with  O
the  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
soup  O
allowing  O
the  O
noodles  O
and  O
wanton  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
wanton  O
with  O
its  O
delectable  O
pork  O
filling  O
stands  O
shoulder  O
with  O
other  O
popular  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
stalls  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
rather  O
average  O
and  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
its  O
own  O
unique  O
character  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
interesting  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
Boon  B-ORG

always  O

able  O
to  O
attract  O
a  O
long  O

eager  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
.  O

Are  O
you  O
a  O

For  O

Most  O

The  O
sea  O
eel  O
barbecued  O
on  O
spot  O
at  O
the  O
live  O
station  O
was  O
very  O
meaty  O
and  O
fat  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
usual  O
farm  O
bred  O
eel  O
.  O

The  O
rich  O
in  O

eel  O
is  O
ideal  O
for  O
the  O
Singapore  O
heat  O
aiding  O
in  O
rejuvenating  O
the  O
body  O

However  O
the  O
fatness  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
much  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

The  O

The  O

opened  O
its  O

As  O
expected  O
,  O
long  O
queues  O
have  O
been  O
formed  O
every  O
day  O
since  O
the  O
opening  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
restaurant  O
takes  O
reservation  O
,  O
only  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
tables  O
are  O
set  O
aside  O
each  O
day  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
wiser  O
to  O
join  O
the  O
queue  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
food  O
as  O
reservation  O
has  O

There  O
are  O
quite  O
a  O

selections  O
from  O
the  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Baked  B-F
Mushroom  I-F
(  O
$  O
12.50  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
crispy  O
paper-thin  O

is  O
topped  O
with  O
sauteed  O
Swiss  O
brown  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
smoked  O
buffalo  O
mozzarella  O
.  O

A  O
delectable  O
antipasti  O
to  O
start  O
of  O
the  O
meal  O
.  O

Crispy  B-F

The  O

we  O
tried  O
was  O
the  O
Crispy  B-F
Squid  I-F
(  O
$  O
11.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
fried  O
squid  O
had  O
a  O
delightful  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
crunchy  O
.  O

The  O
flavour  O
was  O
further  O
lifted  O
with  O
a  O
squeeze  O
of  O
the  O
lemon  O
zest  O
and  O
garlic  O
mayo  O
dip  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
portion  O
was  O
way  O
too  O
small  O
for  O
sharing  O

their  O

its  O
an  O
Italian  O
restaurant  O
after  O
all  O

Inevitably  O

we  O
ordered  O
some  O

Black  B-F

Spaghetti  I-F
(  O

was  O
cooked  O

it  O
in  O
the  O

The  O

While  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
good  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
dish  O
though  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
whole  O
execution  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
bland  O
side  O

The  O

the  O

it  O

The  O
price  O
for  O
homely  O
Italian  O

may  O
be  O
a  O

expensive  O

considering  O
its  O

it  O
is  O
quite  O
reasonable  O
priced  O
.  O

Judging  O
from  O
the  O

queue  O
,  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
mind  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

Staffs  O
are  O
very  O
attentive  O

there  O
was  O
a  O

Initially  O

With  O
a  O

It  O

I  O
like  O
the  O

the  O

is  O
very  O
flavourful  O
absorbing  O
and  O
infusing  O
the  O
robust  O

flavour  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
Triple  O

Beehoon  O
was  O
on  O

necessary  O
for  O
me  O

The  O
King  B-ORG

is  O
Singapore  O
first  O
medieval  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Tucked  O
in  O
a  O
corner  O
at  O
Vivocity  O
on  O
the  O
third  O
level  O
(  O
beside  O
Daiso  O
)  O
,  O
the  O

Teriyaki  B-F
Chicken  I-F
Salad  I-F
3.8/5  O
To  O
whet  O
up  O
our  O
appetite  O
for  O
the  O
banquet  O
feast  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Teriyaki  B-F
Chicken  I-F
Salad  I-F
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
fresh  O
garden  O
salad  O
,  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
breast  O
meat  O
topped  O
with  O
teriyaki  O
sauce  O
and  O
parmesan  O
cheese  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
individual  O
components  O
stood  O
out  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
teriyaki  O
sauce  O
was  O
too  O
much  O
masking  O
off  O
the  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O
greens  O
.  O

Signature  B-F
Mushroom  I-F
Soup  I-F
3.5/5  O
The  O
homemade  O
Signature  B-F
Mushroom  I-F
Soup  I-F
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
mix  O
of  O
button  O
and  O
shiitake  O
mushrooms  O
served  O
with  O
garlic  O
and  O
herbs  O
bread  O
.  O

The  O
creamy  O
mushroom  O
soup  O
was  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
.  O

The  O
serving  O
was  O
pretty  O
huge  O
too  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
found  O
it  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
table  O
disagreed  O
with  O
me  O
.  O

Platter  B-F
C  I-F
3/5  O
When  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
diners  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
always  O
good  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
platter  O
for  O
sharing  O
before  O
the  O
mains  O
are  O
served  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Platter  B-F
C  I-F
(  O
$  O
21.90  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
chicken  O
drumlets  O
,  O
banana  O
bacon  O
bites  O
,  O
golden  O
calamari  O
,  O
prawn  O
twisters  O
and  O
crispy  O
wedges  O
.  O

Not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
fried  O
food  O
but  O
the  O
prawn  O
twister  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
drumlets  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
was  O
dried  O
and  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
banana  O
bacon  O
bites  O
was  O
interesting  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
wow  O
factor  O
.  O

Among  O
all  O
the  O

The  O
baby  O
back  O
ribs  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
easily  O
.  O

The  O
roasted  O
beef  O
was  O
also  O
nicely  O
executed  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
scallop  O
,  O
the  O
snapper  O
and  O
prawn  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
snapper  O
was  O
dried  O
and  O
the  O
prawn  O
was  O
mushy  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
still  O

Back  O
in  O
March  O
2013  O
,  O
I  O
celebrated  O
my  O
birthday  O
by  O
booking  O
a  O
staycation  O
over  O
the  O
weekendat  O
the  O
newly  O
opened  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
.  O

The  O
hotel  O
was  O
designed  O
by  O
local  O
award  O
winning  O
architectural  O
firm  O
Woha  O
,  O
creating  O
a  O
hotel  O
in  O
a  O
garden  O
design  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
recommend  O
the  O
hotel  O
to  O
tourist  O
because  O
of  O
its  O
excellent  O
location  O
that  O
is  O
accessible  O
and  O
a  O
stone  O
throw  O
away  O
to  O
many  O
interesting  O
places  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Chinatown  O
MRT  O
station  O
and  O
Clark  O
Quay  O
MRT  O
station  O
is  O
only  O
5  O
minutes  O
walk  O
away  O
.  O

Right  O
beside  O
the  O
hotel  O
is  O
Hong  O
Lim  O
Food  O
Centre  O
where  O
one  O
can  O
savour  O
the  O
local  O
delicacies  O
.  O

Chinatown  O
,  O
Clark  O
Quay  O
and  O
Boat  O
Quay  O
are  O
also  O
within  O
walking  O
vicinity  O
from  O
the  O
hotel  O
.  O

Lime  B-ORG
is  O
the  O
only  O
restaurant  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
with  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
glass  O
windows  O
and  O
three  O
open  O
kitchens  O
.  O

The  O
spacious  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
friendly  O
and  O
welcoming  O
ambience  O
offering  O
a  O
diverse  O
selection  O
of  O
international  O
cuisines  O
and  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
.  O

My  O
room  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
tenth  O
floor  O
.  O

To  O
get  O
to  O
my  O
room  O
which  O
is  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
hotel  O
,  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
walk  O
through  O
this  O
outdoor  O
corridor  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
closer  O
look  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
the  O
right  O
of  O
the  O
corridor  O
are  O
exactly  O
hotel  O
rooms  O
with  O
greenery  O
wall  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
corridor  O
indoor  O
leading  O
to  O
my  O
hotel  O
room  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
Superior  O
King  O
room  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
booked  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
window  O
design  O
allowing  O
the  O
natural  O
light  O
to  O
light  O
up  O
the  O
room  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
very  O
welcoming  O
ambience  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
hotel  O
creatively  O
uses  O
partition  O
for  O
the  O
room  O
.  O

Noticed  O
the  O
mirror  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
room  O
?  O

It  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
sliding  O
partition  O
.  O

Behind  O
the  O
sliding  O
partition  O
is  O
the  O
toilet  O
and  O
shower  O
room  O
.  O

The  O
toiletries  O
are  O
pretty  O
standard  O
.  O

Beside  O
the  O
comfort  O
king  O
size  O
bed  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
with  O
the  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
windows  O
alot  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
interior  O
deisgner  O
who  O
creatively  O
made  O
used  O
of  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
sitting  O
area  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
table  O
area  O
at  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
beside  O
where  O
the  O
beverages  O
are  O
stored  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
thoughtful  O
design  O
making  O
use  O
of  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
again  O
.  O

The  O
work  O
desk  O
is  O
quite  O
spacious  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
very  O
comfort  O
seat  O
.  O

My  O
booking  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
complimentary  O
access  O
to  O
the  O
rooftop  O
Orchid  O

with  O
a  O

across  O

What  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
is  O
the  O

like  O
structure  O
which  O
is  O
actually  O
oversized  O

President  I-ORG
is  O
the  O
new  O
resident  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
NEX  O
servicing  O
authentic  O
Indonesian  O
cuisine  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
an  O
experience  O
and  O
meal  O
that  O
is  O
fit  O
for  O
a  O
president  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
brought  O
to  O
reality  O
very  O
soon  O
when  O
I  O
needed  O
to  O
walk  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
cashier  O
to  O
place  O
my  O
order  O
and  O
made  O
payment  O
before  O
I  O
got  O
my  O
food  O
served  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
not  O
how  O
you  O
treat  O
a  O
president  O
or  O
rather  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
treated  O
like  O
a  O
president  O
.  O

The  O

(  O

was  O
a  O
big  O
disappointment  O

I  O
was  O
expecting  O
a  O
tall  O
standing  O
tower  O
of  O
the  O

but  O
instead  O
I  O
was  O

with  O
with  O
pieces  O

wrapped  O
in  O

I  O
really  O
felt  O
I  O
was  O
being  O
cheated  O

The  O
Ayam  B-F
Penyet  I-F
(  O

)  O
is  O
a  O
Malay  O
word  O
which  O
literally  O
means  O
smashed  O
fried  O
chicke  O
does  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
steamed  O

.  O

The  B-F
Steamed  I-F
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
0.80  O
)  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
order  O
separately  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
,  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
not  O
flatted  O
or  O
smashed  O
enough  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
wished  O
I  O
could  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
crispy  O
bits  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
tried  O
the  O

in  O

Actually  O
the  O
waitress  O
left  O
out  O
the  O
cut  O
chilii  O
in  O
black  O
sauce  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
asked  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
with  O
the  O
sweet  O
sauce  O
drenched  O
over  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
flavourful  O
.  O

It  O
complemented  O
the  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
chicken  O
.  O

The  O

ended  O
on  O
a  O

with  O
the  O

(  O
$  O

)  O
and  O

(  O

)  O
.  O

The  O
mixed  O
fruit  O
juice  O
a  O

president  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
Chinese  O
version  O
of  O
Ice  O
Kachang  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
here  O
is  O
just  O
average  O
and  O
definitely  O
you  O
wo  O
n't  O
be  O
getting  O
the  O
president  O
treatment  O
.  O

Unless  O
I  O
need  O
a  O
quick  O
meal  O
or  O
avoid  O
the  O
crowd  O
,  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O
not  O
visit  O
the  O
eatery  O

Clark  O
Quay  O
for  O
steamboat  O
at  O
Hai  B-ORG

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
and  O
service  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
great  O
place  O
for  O
group  O
gathering  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
took  O
out  O
my  O
Iphone  O
and  O
Pick  O
this  O
place  O
to  O
share  O
with  O
my  O
friends  O
on  O
Pickat  O
SG  O
.  O

What  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
Pick  O
?  O

In  O
short  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
like  O
Facebook  O
status  O
post  O

you  O
share  O
a  O
Place+  O
Theme  O

also  O
include  O
photos  O

How  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
Pick  O
?  O

Pick  O
is  O
a  O
Place+  O
Theme  O
,  O
so  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
input  O
the  O
location  O
followed  O
by  O
the  O
theme  O
.  O

Simply  O
key  O
in  O
the  O
location  O
of  O
the  O
place  O

outlet  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
make  O
a  O
pick  O
.  O

What  O
is  O
a  O
Theme  O
?  O

A  O
theme  O
is  O
like  O
a  O
label  O
or  O
a  O
post  O
header  O
where  O
it  O
expresses  O
the  O
experience/view/opinion  O
of  O
a  O
place  O
you  O
have  O
visited  O
.  O

The  O
cool  O
part  O
is  O
you  O
can  O
create  O
your  O
own  O
Unique  O
Theme  O
!  O

For  O
example  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
Hai  B-ORG
Di  I-ORG
Lao  I-ORG
Hotpot  I-ORG
is  O
a  O
great  O
place  O
for  O
gathering  O
,  O
hence  O
I  O
created  O
the  O
theme  O
Great  O
Place  O
for  O
Gathering  O
.  O

To  O
complete  O
your  O
Pick  O
,  O
you  O

as  O
well  O
as  O
your  O
review  O
of  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

The  O
great  O
thing  O
is  O

you  O
have  O
completed  O
your  O

from  O

Mr  O

braising  O

After  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
nostalgic  O
flavour  O
of  O
1960s  O
?  O

While  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
flavourful  O
but  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
dry  O
.  O

The  O
kway  O
teow  O
texture  O
was  O
a  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
thick  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
smooth  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
like  O
.  O

Overall  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
a  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
duck  O
noodle  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
rustic  O
taste  O
that  O
probably  O
will  O
bring  O
back  O
childhood  O
memories  O
for  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O

Fat  B-F

(  O
$  O

is  O
a  O
simple  O
and  O
delectable  O
appertiser  O
served  O
with  O
sliced  O
baguettes  O
with  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O

An  O
interesting  O
name  O
but  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
hard  O
to  O
associate  O
the  O
name  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
dish  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O
skip  O
and  O
spend  O
my  O
dollars  O
on  O
other  O
delish  O
dishes  O
on  O

French  B-F

tasting  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
French  B-F
Onion  I-F
Soup  I-F
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
served  O
in  O
a  O

covered  O
with  O
Swiss  O

,  O

The  O
subtlecup  O
of  O
soup  O
was  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
different  O
flavours  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
hope  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
having  O
the  O
exact  O
portion  O
.  O

I  O
will  O
be  O
glad  O
to  O
finish  O
the  O
whole  O
bowl  O

Shio-Koji  B-F
Octopoke  I-F
4.2/5  O
My  O
first  O
introduction  O
to  O
Shio-koji  O
(  O
salted  O
rice  O
malt  O
)  O
is  O
at  O
Japanese  O
Dining  O
SUNat  O
Chijmes  O
hence  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
foreign  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
remembered  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
a  O
platter  O
of  O
shiokoji  O
marinated  O
ingredients  O
and  O
how  O
it  O
enhanced  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
Shio-Koji  B-F
Octopoke  I-F
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
tossed  O
with  O
shiokoji  O
,  O
wasabi  O
,  O
extra  O
virgin  O
oil  O
,  O
avocado  O
and  O
ginger  O
flower  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

The  O
Japanese  O
octopus  O
also  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
and  O
chewy  O
texture  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Umami  B-F

4.2/5  O
A  O
definitely  O
worthy  O
dish  O
to  O
try  O
at  O
Jewel  O

Bar  O
is  O
the  O
Umami  B-F
Prawn  I-F
Capellini  I-F
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
capellini  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
,  O
homemade  O
crustacean  O
oil  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
bonito  O
flakes  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
they  O
used  O
a  O
cooking  O
technique  O
that  O
they  O
learnt  O
from  O
fried  O
hokkien  O
mee  O
to  O
infuse  O
all  O
the  O
wonderful  O
flavours  O
together  O

OMG  B-F
Burger  I-F
4/5  O
All  O
burgers  O
at  O
the  O
cafe  O
are  O
made  O
with  O
USDA  O
beef  O
patties  O
.  O

The  O
whimsical  O
named  O
OMG  B-F
Burger  I-F
(  O
$  O
20  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
150  O
gram  O
beef  O
patty  O
,  O
2  O
slices  O
of  O
crispy  O
bacon  O
,  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
,  O
cheddar  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
onion  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
sunny  O
side  O
up  O
sandwiched  O
between  O
2  O
soft  O
sesame  O
brioche  O
buns  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
fries  O
and  O
salad  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
gives  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
the  O
extra  O
texture  O
and  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
bursting  O
juiciness  O
of  O
a  O
burger  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
burger  O
but  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
think  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
best  O

Desserts  O
for  O
me  O
was  O
rather  O
average  O
for  O
a  O
cafe  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
excitement  O
compared  O
to  O
their  O
whimsical  O
appertisers  O
and  O
mains  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
felt  O
it  O
is  O
overpriced  O
for  O
what  O
is  O
being  O
put  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
do  O
understand  O
that  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
having  O
a  O
bigger  O
pastry  O
kitchen  O
and  O
coming  O
up  O
with  O
more  O
delectable  O
desserts  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
in  O
going  O
back  O
not  O
only  O
for  O
the  O
mains  O
and  O
coffee  O
but  O
their  O
new  O
desserts  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O

(  O

came  O
with  O
an  O
artery  O
clogging  O
thick  O
and  O
robust  O
curry  O
gravy  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
tasted  O
nothing  O
near  O
the  O
Indian  O
or  O
Malay  O
curry  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
its  O
own  O
characteristic  O
representing  O
the  O
Chinese  O
style  O
curry  O
from  O
an  O
over  O
40  O
years  O
old  O
recipe  O
passed  O
down  O
generation  O

The  O

You  O
may  O
not  O
believe  O
it  O
but  O
the  O
curry  O
gravy  O
brings  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
different  O
components  O
together  O
and  O
it  O
actually  O
works  O
in  O
a  O
wonderfully  O
and  O
delectable  O
way  O
.  O

The  O
greasy  O
curry  O
was  O
so  O
addictive  O
that  O
I  O
just  O
ca  O
n't  O
stop  O
until  O
I  O
emptied  O
the  O
whole  O
bowl  O
.  O

I  O

I  O
just  O
have  O
to  O
leave  O

especially  O
after  O

it  O
was  O
the  O

is  O
prepared  O
accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
well  O
guarded  O
recipe  O
from  O
Soon  O
Heng  O
Restaurant  O
dating  O
from  O
1970s  O
,  O
touted  O
as  O
the  O
creator  O
of  O
the  O
Singaporean  O
Chinese  O
style  O
fish  O
head  O
curry  O
.  O

The  O
red  O
snapper  O
fish  O
head  O
is  O
first  O
steamed  O
and  O
then  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
mildly  O
spiced  O
assam  O
or  O
tamarind  O
based  O
curry  O
sauce  O
together  O
with  O
tomatoes  O
lady  O
fingers  O
,  O
sliced  O
onions  O
and  O
fresh  O
chillies  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
is  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
,  O
firm  O
and  O
moist  O
with  O
a  O
delectable  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
flesh  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
spicy  O
level  O
can  O
raise  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
notches  O
more  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
find  O
it  O
spicy  O
at  O
all  O

Sad  O
to  O
say  O
the  O
sambal  O
did  O
not  O
mange  O
to  O
excite  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
pungent  O
aroma  O
and  O
spiciness  O
that  O
will  O
give  O
me  O
an  O
avalanche  O
rush  O

During  O
our  O
visit  O

we  O
managed  O
to  O
try  O
all  O
the  O
seven  O
soup  O
bases  O

they  O
were  O
all  O
disappointing  O

They  O
were  O
either  O
too  O
salty  O
or  O
bland  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
really  O
a  O
pity  O
that  O
the  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
pricing  O
with  O
fresh  O
and  O
quality  O
ingredients  O
were  O
lacked  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
lackluster  O

bases  O

Even  O
the  O
bi  O
monthly  O
yuzu  O

another  O

Unless  O
the  O
restaurant  O
improves  O
with  O
the  O

of  O

safer  O
to  O

.  O

My  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Wu  B-F
Xiang  I-F
Fen  I-F
Ti  I-F
(  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
the  O
the  O
skin  O
of  O
pig  O
trotter  O
and  O
stuffed  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
labour  O
intensive  O
dish  O
that  O
takes  O
more  O
than  O
10  O
hours  O
to  O
prepare  O
.  O

After  O
skinning  O

and  O
stuffing  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
,  O

8  O

The  O
Roast  B-F
Sucking  I-F
Pig  I-F
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
with  O
crackling  O
skin  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
we  O
even  O
dissected  O
the  O
pig  O
head  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
beautifully  O
roasted  O
crackling  O
skin  O
.  O

Steamed  B-F
Pomfret  I-F
3/5  O
I  O
thought  O
Steamed  O
Promfret  O
was  O
a  O
Teochew  O
dish  O
and  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
puzzled  O
when  O
this  O
dish  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
promfret  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
to  O
be  O
shared  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
of  O
11  O
hungry  O
people  O
.  O

The  O

with  I-F
Prawns  I-F
was  O
pretty  O
pedestrian  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
big  O
succulent  O
prawns  O
.  O

Chestnut  B-F
Duck  I-F
4/5  O
The  O
restaurant  O
prefers  O
to  O
use  O
duck  O
that  O
weights  O
between  O
1.8kg  O
to  O
2kg  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
size  O
with  O
tender  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
Chestnut  B-F
Duck  I-F
was  O
indeed  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
apart  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

Hokkien  B-F

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O

Rice  I-F

is  O
stir  O

is  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
bouncy  O
and  O
chewy  O
rice  O
cakes  O
coated  O
with  O
fragrant  O

.  O

This  O
is  O
something  O
I  O
will  O

in  O
my  O

was  O
one  O

the  O

The  O
beehoon  O
was  O
also  O
smooth  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
slippery  O
that  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
holding  O
them  O
on  O

The  O

a  O

different  O
from  O
the  O

The  O

wetter  O

to  O
the  O

It  O

those  O

This  O
is  O
really  O
an  O

The  O

special  O
and  O
soft  O
.  O

You  O
probably  O
ca  O

find  O
it  O
elsewhere  O

The  O
best  O
way  O
to  O

is  O
to  O
dip  O
it  O
into  O
the  O

up  O
the  O
delicious  O
sauce  O

It  O
is  O

that  O

method  O

I  O
made  O
my  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
Flor  B-ORG
Patisserie  I-ORG
and  O
was  O
lucky  O
to  O
get  O
a  O
whole  O
cake  O
as  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
make  O
any  O
pre-order  O
.  O

Flor  O
Patisserie  O
is  O
opened  O
by  O
Chef  O
Yamashita  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
Japanese  O
styled  O
patisserie  O
serving  O
authentic  O
Japanese  O
inspired  O
French  O
pastry  O
.  O

Chef  O
Yamashita  O
brings  O
with  O
him  O
over  O
20  O
years  O
of  O
baking  O
techniques  O
to  O
Singapore  O
and  O
spent  O
a  O
year  O
and  O
a  O
half  O
tailoring  O
his  O
signature  O
cakes  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
climate  O
and  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

I  O
got  O
the  O
Berry  B-F
Berries  I-F
(  O
17x12  O
for  O
$  O
38.85  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
soft  O
sponge  O
that  O
is  O
made  O
traditionally  O
without  O
baking  O
powder  O
nor  O
any  O
chemical  O
raising  O
agent  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
filled  O
with  O
fresh  O
strawberries  O
and  O
luscious  O
cream  O
topped  O
with  O
summer  O
berries  O
and  O
fresh  O
fruits  O
.  O

I  O
dislike  O
cakes  O
that  O
are  O
dry  O
,  O
sweet  O
and  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
too  O
much  O
cream  O
.  O

The  O
Berry  O
Berries  O
cake  O
was  O
totally  O
the  O
opposite  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
well  O
harmonized  O
.  O

The  O
cake  O
was  O
very  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

The  O
price  O
is  O
also  O
very  O
reasonable  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
pastries  O
at  O
Flor  O
Patisserie  O
is  O
made  O
entirely  O
of  O
natural  O
and  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
,  O
they  O
do  O
not  O
keep  O
well  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
is  O
best  O
to  O
be  O
consumed  O
on  O
the  O
day  O
itself  O
.  O

Flor  O
Patisserie  O
firmly  O
believes  O
in  O
using  O
on  O
the  O
best  O

to  O

that  O

Chicken  O
uses  O
only  O
free  O

kampong  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O

(  O
$  O
9.50  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O

and  O

The  O

has  O
a  O
more  O
intense  O

compare  O
to  O
those  O
we  O

had  O
.  O

Besides  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
nothing  O
special  O
about  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
find  O
the  O

a  O
bit  O
stingy  O
with  O
the  O
pricing  O
for  O

I  O
realized  O
that  O
the  O

does  O
not  O
serve  O

for  O
my  O
chicken  O

,  O
so  O
I  O
separately  O

a  O

The  O
pork  O

was  O
rather  O
decent  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
am  O
quite  O
disappointed  O
with  O

If  O
I  O
am  O

the  O

In  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O
mee  O
siam  O
,  O
there  O
were  O
luxurious  O
servicing  O
of  O
crayfish  O
,  O
chicken  O

prawn  O
and  O
eggs  O
.  O

I  O
was  O

the  O

the  O
spicy  O

sweet  O
and  O

gravy  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lighter  O
colour  O
,  O
smoother  O
texture  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
less  O
oily  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Malay  O
and  O

versions  O

In  O
short  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
a  O
more  O
healthy  O
version  O
but  O
not  O
compromising  O
in  O
taste  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
better  O

Before  O
leaving  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
my  O
luck  O
to  O
check  O
with  O
the  O
uncle  O
what  O
fruits  O
were  O
added  O
to  O
gravy  O
but  O
he  O
refuses  O
to  O
tell  O
me  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

He  O
only  O
tells  O
me  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
is  O
needed  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
gravy  O
and  O
it  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
boiled  O
by  O
a  O
good  O
2  O
hours  O
.  O

I  O
suspect  O
pineapple  O
and  O
lime  O
were  O
added  O
.  O
