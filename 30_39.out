This  O
little  O

located  O

reminds  O
me  O
of  O
those  O

The  O

the  O

there  O
is  O
a  O

The  O
Sashimi  O
was  O
very  O
fresh  O
andcut  O
into  O
chunk  O
instead  O
of  O
slices  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
more  O
enjoyable  O
with  O
the  O
cut  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
aroused  O
my  O
interests  O
with  O
itsvarious  O
sauces  O
and  O

The  O

was  O
stored  O
in  O
a  O
traditional  O

a  O

The  O
grinder  O
for  O
the  O

came  O
in  O

of  O
a  O

this  O

The  O
Loin  O

was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
best  O
.  O

A  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
that  O
the  O

had  O
a  O

of  O

which  O
was  O
slightly  O
thick  O
to  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O

instead  O
.  O

The  O
Golden  O
Mushroom  O
wrapped  O
with  O
Beef  O
slices  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
but  O
was  O
well  O
cooked  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
common  O
dish  O
but  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
golden  O
mushroom  O
and  O
beef  O
is  O
like  O
amarriage  O
made  O
in  O
heaven  O
.  O

This  O
dish  O
simply  O
was  O
a  O
delight  O
with  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O

it  O

The  O

was  O

It  O
was  O
really  O
amazing  O
that  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O
crispy  O

too  O

However  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
remove  O
the  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
underneath  O
the  O
skin  O
as  O
it  O
had  O

I  O

The  O

The  O
thickness  O
probably  O
came  O

Several  O
friends  O
have  O

to  O
me  O
about  O

to  O
check  O

on  O
my  O
off  O
day  O
on  O
Australia  O

a  O
strong  O
aroma  O
of  O

The  O

Their  O

story  O
dated  O
back  O
to  O
2006  O
from  O
a  O
humble  O
stall  O
in  O
Hougang  O

into  O

business  O
with  O
chains  O
opening  O
up  O
at  O
different  O
corners  O
of  O
Singapore  O
.  O

original  O

and  O
the  O
very  O
first  O
store  O
was  O
birthed  O
on  O
August  O
2006  O
at  O

for  O

I  O

both  O

For  O
the  O

I  O
like  O
the  O

of  O
using  O
peanut  O

with  O
the  O

instead  O
of  O
just  O

I  O
was  O
asking  O
my  O
Pakistan  O
colleague  O
of  O
any  O
nice  O
Indian  O
restaurants  O
at  O
Little  O

the  O
other  O

the  O

me  O

at  O

I  O
suspect  O
this  O
place  O
should  O
be  O
quite  O
well  O
known  O
when  O
I  O
saw  O
a  O
Caucasian  O
family  O
eating  O
at  O
the  O
coffeeshop  O
.  O

I  O
googled  O
and  O
indeed  O
this  O

was  O
featured  O
in  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
food  O

I  O
left  O
the  O

I  O

to  O

restaurants  O

Could  O
it  O
be  O
the  O
restaurant  O
name  O
that  O
gives  O
the  O
misconception  O
?  O

Anyway  O
...  O
at  O
least  O
I  O
need  O
not  O
queue  O
whenever  O
I  O
visited  O
Coffee  O
Club  O
.  O

I  O
browsed  O
through  O
the  O
menu  O
and  O
realized  O
they  O
have  O
introduced  O
a  O
few  O
new  O
dishes  O
since  O
my  O
last  O
visit  O
.  O

I  O
settledfor  O

Crumbed  O
fish  O
fillet  O
with  O
Hollandaise  O
and  O
Mexican  O
Quessadilla  O

The  O
herb  O
crust  O
over  O
the  O
fish  O
fillet  O
was  O
crispy  O
,  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O

The  O

quite  O
popular  O

do  O
expect  O
a  O
long  O
wait  O

The  O
other  O
important  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
stall  O
is  O
the  O
satay  O

Unlike  O
others  O
,  O
the  O

I  O

Nagoya  O

Shopping  O
Mall  O
which  O
is  O
about  O
20-25  O
minutes  O
car  O

I  O
usually  O
went  O
there  O
to  O
do  O
some  O

as  O
having  O
my  O
A  O

After  O

was  O
at  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
restaurant  O
built  O
on  O

a  O

I  O
suspected  O
it  O
is  O
aprawn  O

which  O
was  O
how  O
the  O
restaurant  O

came  O
about  O

There  O
is  O
another  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Golden  O

it  O

Both  O

should  O
be  O

the  O

came  O

the  O

from  O

version  O

very  O

Previosuly  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
written  O
a  O
post  O
on  O
VeganBurg  O
stating  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
selling  O
vegetarian  O
burgers  O
.  O

Technically  O
I  O
am  O
wrong  O
,  O
the  O
burgers  O
at  O
VeganBurgalso  O
excludes  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
eggs  O
,  O
dairy  O
products  O
and  O
other  O
animal-derived  O
ingredients  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
VeganBurg  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
their  O
burgers  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
way  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
amazed  O
by  O
how  O
tasty  O
the  O
burgers  O
were  O
even  O
though  O
it  O
excludes  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
meat  O
and  O
animal-derived  O
ingredients  O
.  O

I  O

Walk  O

a  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
price  O
was  O
quite  O
reasonable  O
so  O
I  O
settled  O
for  O
the  O
restaurant  O
to  O
have  O
my  O
dinner  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
drink  O
and  O
side  O
dishes  O
were  O
refillable  O
.  O

The  O
barley  O
tea  O
was  O
nothing  O
special  O
but  O
basically  O

dishes  O
were  O
decent  O

did  O
not  O
impress  O
me  O
much  O

,  O
the  O

were  O
good  O
and  O
value  O
for  O

.  O

The  O

were  O
also  O

to  O
see  O
the  O

I  O

of  O
us  O
may  O
have  O
visited  O
Yum  O

Restaurant  O
for  O
its  O
Dim  O

Even  O
the  O
name  O
itself  O
Yum  O
Cha  O
which  O
meant  O
tea  O
drinking  O
in  O

suggested  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
a  O

place  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
be  O
mislead  O
by  O
the  O
name  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
a  O
good  O
variety  O
of  O

up  O

which  O
I  O
found  O
it  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
this  O
dish  O
wondering  O
how  O
an  O
Italian  O
restaurant  O
will  O
present  O
the  O
suckling  O
pig  O
in  O
its  O
menu  O
?  O

I  O
was  O
pleasantly  O
surprised  O
when  O
I  O
am  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
big  O
piece  O
of  O
pork  O
instead  O
in  O
a  O
thin  O
slice  O
where  O
how  O
Chinese  O
restaurant  O
normally  O
served  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O
crispy  O
and  O
the  O
pork  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

A  O
very  O
well  O
executed  O
dish  O

Dessert  O
was  O
creme  O

Simply  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
with  O
the  O
creme  O

with  O
its  O
moist  O
custard  O
base  O
and  O
burnt  O

on  O
the  O

How  O
I  O
wish  O
the  O

could  O
have  O
served  O

dinner  O
was  O
rounded  O
up  O
with  O
a  O

I  O
googled  O
and  O
petit  O
fours  O

food  O

Price  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
steep  O
but  O
definitely  O
worth  O
it  O
for  O
the  O

My  O
friends  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
for  O
4  O
person  O
.  O

For  O
the  O

we  O
went  O
for  O

Yes  O
it  O

``  O

''  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
(  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
spelling  O
error  O
)  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
starter  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
fried  O
fish  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
dip  O
for  O
the  O
fried  O
fish  O
skin  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
fried  O
fish  O
skin  O
was  O
crispy  O
and  O
nice  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
size  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
compare  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

Next  O
up  O
was  O
fun  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
presented  O
with  O
a  O
tray  O
of  O
12  O
ingredients  O
for  O
us  O
to  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
our  O
own  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Lastly  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
main  O
.  O

When  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
commotion  O
in  O
the  O
group.We  O
realizedthe  O
prawns  O
were  O
alive  O
and  O
moving  O
.  O

OK  O
!  O

this  O
is  O
really  O
fresh  O
!  O

It  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
a  O
disturbing  O
sight  O
to  O
some  O
when  O
the  O
prawns  O
struggled  O
in  O
the  O
hot  O
steamboat  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O
seafood  O
,  O
the  O
pork  O
and  O
beef  O
were  O
of  O
premium  O
quality  O
too  O

I  O
knew  O
I  O
am  O
won  O
over  O

was  O
also  O
very  O
fresh  O
.  O

One  O

we  O
can  O
tell  O
the  O

was  O
freshly  O
preparedon  O

instead  O
of  O
using  O
frozen  O

What  O
wows  O
me  O
more  O
was  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
spinach  O

egg  O
in  O
the  O

a  O
good  O
balance  O
to  O
the  O
heavy  O
flavouring  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
fried  O

was  O
a  O
surprise  O
to  O
me  O
and  O
my  O
first  O
having  O
it  O

The  O

a  O
bit  O
difficult  O
to  O
locate  O
as  O
the  O

For  O
the  O

,  O
you  O
need  O
to  O

I  O
think  O
Curry  O

has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
5  O
years  O
even  O
when  O
the  O

was  O
still  O
at  O

for  O

craved  O
for  O
the  O
these  O
two  O

I  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
ages  O
since  O
I  O
lasted  O
visited  O
Curry  O
Favour  O
so  O
I  O
suggested  O
Curry  O

for  O
our  O
monthly  O
kaki  O
gathering  O
.  O

We  O
decided  O
to  O
order  O
some  O
appetizers  O
while  O
waiting  O
for  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
group  O
to  O
turn  O
up  O
.  O

The  O
mushroom  O
fry  O
was  O
still  O
very  O
excellent  O
,  O
big  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

The  O
cheese  O

was  O
very  O
good  O
too  O

I  O
have  O
the  O
Rosu  O

(  O

)  O
and  O
Hire  O
Katsu  O
(  O
pork  O

Unlike  O
Indian  O
curry  O
,  O
Japanese  O
curry  O
are  O
on  O
the  O
sweet  O
side  O
so  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
katsu  O
was  O
also  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

Crispy  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
in  O
the  O
inside  O

My  O

Beef  O
Curry  O
(  O

)  O
and  O
Rosu  O
Katsu  O
&  O
Fish  O

Combo  O
were  O
very  O
good  O
too  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
Slow  O
Stewed  O
Beef  O
Brisket  O
curry  O
was  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
sauce  O
was  O
good  O
but  O
the  O
beef  O
was  O
tasteless  O
.  O

My  O
advice  O
is  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
katsu  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Japanese  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
eating  O
at  O
Daikokuya  O
.  O

The  O
ramen  O
restaurant  O
serves  O
four  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
ramen  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
the  O
Sapporo  O
ramen  O
,  O
Tokyo-style  O

Kyushu-style  O

and  O
Kogashi  O

My  O
friends  O
and  O
I  O
started  O
off  O
with  O
their  O
Gyoza  O
which  O
were  O
nicely  O
pan  O
fried  O
with  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
crispyness  O
to  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

Usually  O
restaurant  O
served  O
black  O
vinegar  O
for  O
the  O
gyoza  O
dip  O
but  O
it  O
used  O
white  O
vinegar  O
here  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
white  O
vinegar  O
with  O
gyoza  O
before  O
and  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
.  O

,  O
served  O

The  O

were  O

I  O
basically  O
emptied  O
it  O

Kogashi  O

During  O
the  O
Mid  O
Autumn  O
Festival  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
buy  O
mooncakes  O
home  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
kind  O
of  O
Chinese  O
tradition  O
that  O
I  O
will  O
do  O
every  O
year  O
.  O

Even  O
companies  O
will  O
send  O
mooncakes  O
to  O
their  O
customers  O
as  O
gift  O
during  O
this  O
festive  O
occasion  O
.  O

Mooncakes  O
nowadays  O
came  O
in  O
all  O
sort  O
of  O
creativity  O
.  O

Even  O
hotels  O
and  O
restaurants  O
came  O
out  O
with  O
their  O
own  O
signature  O
mooncake  O
.  O

Being  O
a  O
durian  O
lover  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
resist  O
buying  O
the  O
Peony  O
Jade  O
durian  O
mooncake  O
,  O
especially  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
100  O
%  O
pure  O
top  O
grade  O

The  O
strong  O
durian  O
aroma  O
filled  O
the  O
air  O
onceI  O
sliced  O
the  O
mooncake  O
.  O

The  O
durian  O
filling  O
was  O
very  O
rich  O
and  O
nice  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
pandan  O
snowskin  O
was  O
a  O
bad  O
combination  O
which  O
spoilt  O
the  O
richness  O
taste  O
of  O
the  O
durian  O
filling  O
.  O

vegetarian  O

Currently  O
,  O

5  O
different  O
type  O
of  O
burgers  O
namely  O
,  O
Cracked  O
Pepper  O

,  O
Hawaiian  O
Pineapple  O
,  O
Smoky  O

,  O
Char-Grilled  O

Sample  O
of  O
the  O
menu  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Cracked  O
Pepper  O
Mayo  O
meal  O
(  O
which  O
contains  O
Omega  O
3  O
,  O
Omega  O
6  O
,  O
Zinc  O
)  O
while  O
my  O
partner  O
ordered  O
the  O
Smoky  O
BBQ  O
meal  O
(  O
which  O
contains  O
Beta-Carotene  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
mealalso  O
included  O
fries  O
and  O
juice  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
,  O
the  O
burgers  O
tasted  O
very  O
yummy  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
way  O
beyond  O
my  O
expectation  O
for  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
burger  O
.  O

The  O
cracked  O
pepper  O
mayo  O
patty  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
soya  O
flavour  O
while  O
the  O
smoky  O
BBQ  O
patty  O
had  O
a  O
mushroomy  O
flavour  O
.  O

Being  O
a  O
meat  O
person  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
I  O
may  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
``  O
filling  O
''  O
satisfaction  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
wrong  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
full  O
and  O
satisfied  O
after  O
the  O
meal  O
.  O

I  O
mentioned  O
relaunched  O
because  O
I  O
remembered  O
there  O
was  O
Texas  O
Chicken  O
in  O
the  O
1980  O
's  O
if  O
my  O
memories  O
were  O
correct  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
thanks  O
to  O
Select  O

,  O
they  O
have  O
brought  O
Texas  O

the  O

at  O
Texas  O
Chicken  O
was  O
less  O

.  O

HoweverI  O
thought  O
the  O
chicken  O
lacked  O
the  O
fragrance  O
in  O
their  O
seasoning  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
nice  O

I  O
preferred  O
theirs  O
to  O
Popeye  O

After  O
hearing  O
a  O
fair  O
bit  O
about  O
this  O
eatery  O
place  O
,  O
I  O
took  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
visit  O
this  O
place  O
by  O
suggesting  O
to  O
my  O
colleague  O
for  O
her  O
farewell  O
dinner  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
not  O
easy  O
to  O
locate  O
this  O
place  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
on  O
the  O
main  O
road  O
.  O

After  O
you  O
alightat  O
the  O

,  O
you  O
need  O

turn  O
into  O

,  O
you  O
are  O
at  O
the  O

We  O
ordered  O
the  O
Wasuga  O

Initially  O
I  O

it  O
was  O
some  O

I  O
only  O
realized  O
it  O
meant  O
``  O

``  O

to  O
share  O
.  O

The  O
sausage  O
and  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
were  O
nice  O
.  O

We  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
additional  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
served  O
with  O
potato  O
skins  O
.  O

The  O

with  O

The  O

was  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
located  O

I  O
understand  O

a  O

has  O
also  O

I  O

at  O

so  O
myfriends  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O

it  O
out  O
.  O

It  O
basically  O
offers  O
both  O
steamboat  O
and  O

it  O
used  O

here  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

Intended  O
to  O
introduce  O
my  O
friend  O
to  O
the  O
new  O
parchment  O

but  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

It  O
seemed  O
like  O
the  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
was  O
over  O
baked  O
and  O
the  O
pasta  O
was  O

Some  O

it  O

the  O

turned  O
out  O
fine  O

it  O

can  O
be  O

,  O
you  O

I  O

I  O

it  O
was  O
an  O
unique  O

as  O
I  O

not  O

dry  O

before  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
spicy  O
at  O
all  O

The  O

turned  O
out  O

It  O
wasmy  O
off  O

so  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
Marina  O
Bay  O
Sands  O

Park  O
with  O
my  O
friend  O
.  O

Indeed  O
the  O
view  O
at  O
the  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
Sky  O

was  O
magnificent  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
at  O

it  O

Anyway  O
after  O

around  O
,  O
I  O
settled  O
at  O

a  O

that  O
offered  O

Changi  O
Airport  O
Terminal  O

is  O
currently  O
under  O
upgrading  O
but  O
some  O
sections  O
were  O
alreadycompleted  O
and  O
a  O
few  O
new  O
restaurants  O
have  O
opened  O
its  O
door  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
them  O
is  O
Pizza  O
Hut  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
ages  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
ate  O
at  O
Pizza  O
Hut  O
.  O

Thereare  O
a  O
lot  O
more  O
varieties  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
offering  O
not  O
only  O
pizza  O
but  O
pasta  O
,  O
baked  O
rice  O
,  O
salads  O
and  O
desserts  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
my  O
colleagues  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
told  O
that  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
20  O
minutes  O
for  O
the  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
so  O
we  O
ordered  O
their  O
hut  O
platter  O
appetiser  O
as  O
we  O
were  O
quite  O
hungry  O
.  O

The  O
hut  O
platter  O
came  O
with  O
fries  O
,  O
calamari  O
,  O
drumlets  O
and  O
scallop  O
rolls  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
food  O
standard  O
.  O

The  O
seasoning  O
for  O
the  O
drumlets  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
pasta  O
came  O
wrappedin  O
parchment  O
paper  O
and  O
a  O
wooden  O
clip  O
.  O

The  O
serving  O
were  O
quite  O
generous  O
for  O
both  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
spicy  O
seafood  O
asthe  O
saucehad  O
a  O
stronger  O
flavouring  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
char-grilled  O
chicken  O
would  O
be  O
better  O
if  O
the  O
sauce  O
was  O
more  O
creamy  O
.  O

Overall  O

The  O

This  O

to  O

Since  O
the  O
queue  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
long  O
,  O
I  O
bought  O
a  O
box  O
of  O
3  O
takoyaki  O
to  O
try  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
feeling  O
a  O

the  O
staff  O
frying  O
the  O
takoyaki  O
in  O
the  O
pan  O
mold  O
filled  O
with  O
oil.I  O
was  O
taken  O
back  O
by  O
how  O
much  O
oil  O
he  O
was  O
using  O
.  O

Not  O
sure  O
whether  O
thisis  O
their  O
unique  O
way  O
of  O
preparing  O
the  O
takoyaki  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
quite  O
nice  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
oily  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
takoyaki  O
a  O
better  O

I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
of  O
this  O
place  O
from  O
the  O
food  O
tweet  O
community  O
.  O

The  O
concept  O
is  O
western  O
food  O
with  O
a  O
Hainanese  O
twist  O
at  O
coffee  O
shop  O
price  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
they  O
are  O
Halal  O
too  O
.  O

Currently  O
,  O
they  O
have  O
another  O
2  O
branches  O
at  O
Lorong  O
Ah  O
Soo  O
and  O
Bishan  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
rosemary  O
lamb  O
rack  O
,  O
black  O
pepper  O
chicken  O
,  O
2  O
teh  O

a  O

all  O
came  O
to  O
a  O
total  O
bill  O
of  O
$  O
20.20  O
.  O

That  O
was  O
cheap  O
is  O
n't  O
it  O
?  O

For  O
the  O
price  O
I  O
am  O
paying  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
surprised  O
by  O
the  O
standard  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
especially  O
the  O
main  O
courses  O
.  O

The  O
lamb  O
and  O
chicken  O
were  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

Definitely  O
better  O
than  O
some  O
restaurantsI  O
have  O
eaten  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
mushroom  O
soup  O
could  O
be  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
diluted  O
and  O
lack  O
the  O
thick  O
mushroom  O
flavour  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O

when  O
I  O
was  O

last  O

I  O
was  O
excited  O
about  O
its  O

and  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
sink  O
my  O
teeth  O
into  O
their  O
famous  O
peri  O

.  O

Nando  O
's  O
did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
me  O
with  O
their  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
one  O
I  O
had  O
in  O

came  O

There  O
was  O
already  O
a  O
queue  O
when  O
I  O
got  O
there  O
.  O

Eating  O
here  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
stressful  O
,  O
their  O
businesswas  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
they  O
will  O
start  O
asking  O
customers  O
to  O
stand  O
and  O
wait  O
beside  O
your  O
table  O
when  O
you  O
are  O
left  O
with  O
your  O

.  O

Everythingwas  O
about  O

,  O

and  O
eat  O
fast  O
.  O

The  O
waiters/waitresswere  O
super  O
efficient  O
and  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
scary  O
to  O
some  O
but  O
polite  O
.  O

Breakfast  O
set  O
was  O
rather  O
standard  O

If  O

I  O
would  O

noticed  O
the  O

I  O

to  O

I  O
have  O
walked  O
passed  O
the  O

twice  O
but  O
never  O
stepped  O
inside  O
.  O

Indeed  O
the  O
mee  O
pok  O
drywas  O
very  O
special  O
and  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
mee  O
pok  O
seemed  O
shorter  O
and  O
more  O
``  O

than  O
the  O
norm  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
for  O
the  O
mee  O
pok  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
that  O
gave  O
it  O
a  O
very  O
unique  O
and  O
special  O
flavouring  O
.  O

In  O
the  O

there  O
were  O

Recently  O
the  O
restaurants  O
at  O
Sunset  O
Way  O
were  O
featured  O
in  O
theSunday  O
Times.Some  O
restaurants  O
may  O
call  O
it  O
a  O
day  O
after  O
being  O
asked  O
to  O
renew  O
tenancies  O
at  O
higher  O
rents  O
up  O
to  O
80  O
%  O
more  O
.  O

The  O
restaurants  O
are  O
still  O
in  O
negotiation  O
with  O
the  O
tenant  O
and  O
hopefully  O
they  O
are  O
not  O
forced  O
to  O
close  O
their  O
business  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
just  O
in  O
case  O
the  O
restaurants  O
decided  O
to  O
desert  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
was  O
very  O
vibrant  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
restaurants  O
were  O
crowded  O
.  O

I  O
settled  O

us  O
,  O
we  O
could  O
not  O

I  O

Mr  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
opened  O
by  O
the  O
retrenched  O
chef  O
from  O
Chatterbox  O
at  O
the  O
Mandarin  O
hotel  O
.  O

A  O
big  O
newspaper  O

displayed  O
in  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
self  O

You  O
placed  O
your  O
order  O
with  O
the  O
cashier  O
(  O
the  O
chef  O

the  O
newspaper  O

)  O
,  O
paid  O
and  O
collected  O
your  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
2  O
person  O
combo  O
meal  O
that  O
came  O
with  O
chicken  O
,  O
a  O
selection  O

(  O

and  O
two  O
bowls  O

.  O

Being  O
branded  O
as  O
the  O
Chatterbox  O

rice  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
as  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
quite  O
normal  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
eaten  O
better  O
ones  O
eleswhere  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
had  O
a  O
rich  O
chicken  O
and  O
ginger  O
flavour  O
but  O
the  O
rice  O
was  O
too  O
hard  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
get  O
me  O
wrong  O
,  O
the  O
chicken  O
rice  O
was  O
good  O
but  O
maybe  O
I  O
was  O
disappointed  O
by  O

After  O
doing  O
some  O
research  O
on  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
I  O
realiseditused  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
Zi  O
Char  O
stall  O
in  O
Marine  O
Parade  O
before  O
it  O
shifted  O
to  O
the  O
current  O
place  O
in  O
Macpherson  O
.  O

The  O
Crab  O
Bee  O
Hoon  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

Thebee  O
hoon  O
they  O
usedabsorbed  O
the  O
crab  O
flavour  O
very  O
well  O
.  O

The  O
crabs  O
were  O
excellent  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
pincers  O
are  O
large  O
and  O
the  O
meat  O
is  O
full  O
but  O
at  O
a  O
cost  O
of  O
$  O
45  O
per  O
kg  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
dish  O
that  O
wasreally  O
good  O
is  O
the  O
steamed  O
flower  O
clams  O
(  O

.  O

The  O
saucewas  O

typical  O

The  O
yam  O
paste  O
herewas  O
thick  O

gooey  O
unlike  O
those  O
watery  O

Instead  O
of  O
using  O

the  O

it  O

Mashing  O
the  O

together  O
with  O
the  O

was  O
another  O
excellent  O

This  O

had  O
an  O

me  O
about  O
25  O
minutes  O
in  O
the  O

to  O
order  O
my  O
fish  O

The  O

was  O

However  O

I  O
was  O
invited  O
to  O
a  O
wedding  O
dinner  O
at  O
the  O
Grassroots  O

Yio  O
Chu  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
was  O
not  O
expecting  O
much  O
from  O
a  O
neighbourhood  O
restaurant.I  O
was  O
in  O
for  O
a  O
surprise  O
.  O

The  O
food  O
was  O
good  O
and  O
of  O
great  O
standard  O
.  O

The  O
Buddha  O
Jump  O
Over  O
the  O
Wall  O
impressed  O
me  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

The  O
ingredients  O
were  O
well  O
stewed  O
and  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
.  O

In  O
the  O

I  O
even  O
helped  O
myself  O
to  O
a  O
second  O

.  O

The  O
Pipa  O
Duck  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
skin  O
was  O
very  O
crispy  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
roasted  O
to  O

and  O
the  O
special  O

was  O
an  O
excellent  O
combination  O
for  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
with  O
the  O

which  O
should  O
have  O
more  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
was  O
not  O
expecting  O
much  O
from  O
a  O
neighbourhood  O
restaurant.I  O
was  O
in  O
for  O
a  O
surprise  O
.  O

The  O
food  O
was  O
good  O
and  O
of  O
great  O
standard  O
.  O

The  O
Buddha  O
Jump  O
Over  O
the  O
Wall  O
impressed  O
me  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

The  O
ingredients  O
were  O
well  O
stewed  O
and  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
.  O

In  O
the  O

were  O

and  O
the  O

was  O
an  O
excellent  O
combination  O
for  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
with  O
the  O
lobster  O
deluxe  O
combination  O
which  O
should  O
have  O
more  O

.  O
