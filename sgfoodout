For  O
a  O
limited  O
periodfrom  O
22  O

12  O
May  O
2013  O
,  O
Straits  O
Caf  O
at  O
Rendezvous  O
Grand  O
Hotel  O
Singapore  O
has  O
invited  O
Korean  O
guest  O
Chef  O
Kim  O
Hyun  O
Jung  O
from  O
Lotte  O
World  O
to  O
present  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
as  O
part  O
of  O
its  O
International  O
buffet  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
already  O
quite  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
Korean  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Singapore  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
us  O
are  O
rather  O
familiar  O
with  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
worthwhile  O
to  O
visit  O
Straits  O
Cafe  O
for  O
their  O
buffet  O
as  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
prepared  O
by  O
Chef  O
Kim  O
Hyun  O
Jung  O
is  O
not  O
commonly  O
served  O
in  O
local  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Banchan  O
Banchan  O
(  O
side  O
dishes  O
)  O
is  O
like  O
astaple  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

At  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
buffet  O
,  O
the  O
spread  O
also  O
offers  O
some  O
side  O
dishes  O
such  O
as  O
Zucchini  O
,  O
Bean  O
Sprouts  O
,  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Vermicelli  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
side  O
dishes  O
is  O
the  O
kimchi  O
.  O

Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
4/5  O
This  O
is  O
quite  O
interesting  O
for  O
my  O
limited  O
knowledge  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
exactly  O
has  O
rice  O
in  O
it  O
and  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
having  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
porridge  O
instead  O
of  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

The  O
hearty  O
bowl  O
of  O
Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
was  O
very  O
comforting  O
with  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
chicken  O
,  O
water  O
chestnut  O
and  O
ginseng  O
.  O

One  O
can  O
also  O
add  O
a  O
pinch  O
of  O
sea  O
salt  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavour  O
further  O
.  O

Seabass  O
and  O
Zucchini  O
Pancakes  O
3.5/4  O
I  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
Seabass  O
and  O
Zucchini  O
Pancakes  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
coat  O
of  O
flour  O
and  O
egg  O
batter  O
.  O

Itwas  O
rather  O
bland  O
if  O
eaten  O
without  O
sauces  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
dipping  O
soy  O
sauce  O
that  O
made  O
the  O
pancakes  O
shone  O
,  O
accentuating  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
dimension  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Hot  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
3/5  O
Resembling  O
our  O
local  O
curry  O
chicken  O
,  O
the  O
Korean  O
version  O
of  O
Hot  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
was  O
rather  O
mild  O
and  O
fiery  O
free  O
to  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

Beef  O
Ribs  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
prime  O
Beef  O
Ribs  O
was  O
beautiful  O
marinated  O
and  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
succulent  O
and  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
.  O

Probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
diners  O
as  O
I  O
noticed  O
a  O

us  O

Rice  O

The  O

)  O
,  O
Cinnamon  O
(  O
Brown  O
)  O
and  O
Green  O
Tea  O
(  O

.  O

The  O
chewy  O
texture  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyable  O
and  O
the  O
Honey  O
Citron  O
Tea  O
was  O
perfect  O
to  O
wash  O
it  O
down  O
and  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
4.5/5  O
My  O
all  O
time  O
favourite  O
fish  O
steamboat  O
place  O
is  O
at  O
Nam  O
Hwa  O
Chong  O
(  O
Ah  O
Chew  O
)  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
Corner  O
(  O
)  O
at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
Jalan  O
Sultan  O
and  O
North  O
Bridge  O
Road  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
oldest  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
since  O
1927  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
said  O
by  O
many  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
the  O
creator  O
of  O
the  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
.  O

Now  O
run  O
by  O
the  O
3rd  O
generation  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
still  O
continues  O
to  O
use  O
charcoal  O
for  O
their  O
traditional  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
slurp  O
worthy  O
rich  O
and  O
sweet  O
tastes  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
fish  O
,  O
grouper  O
and  O
promfret  O
are  O
more  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
patrons  O
.  O

Oyster  O
Omelette  O
3/5  O
Beside  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
serves  O
some  O
delectable  O
Zi  O
Char  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
Oyster  O
Omelette  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
oysters  O
were  O
also  O
rather  O
small  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
3/5  O
The  O
Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
were  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
pungent  O
prawn  O
paste  O
taste  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
milder  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
prawn  O
paste  O
chicken  O
wings  O
which  O
suit  O
those  O
who  O
dislike  O
the  O
acquire  O
prawn  O
paste  O
taste  O
.  O

4/5  O
The  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Sambal  O
Tapiocal  O
Leaves  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
actually  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
but  O
fragrant  O
enough  O
,  O
not  O
overcooked  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchiness  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Roll  O
4/5  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
Prawn  O
Roll  O
too  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
packed  O
with  O
flavourful  O
filling  O
with  O
occasional  O
crunchy  O
bites  O
of  O
water  O
chestnuts  O
.  O

For  O
my  O
birthday  O
celebration  O
with  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
this  O
year  O
,  O
I  O
suggested  O
The  O
Clan  O
Restaurant  O
which  O
is  O
nearby  O
our  O
staycation  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
.  O

The  O
2  O
storeyrestaurant  O
is  O
nestled  O
inside  O
a  O
100  O
over  O
years  O
old  O
building  O
that  O
is  O
also  O
The  O
GAN  O
Clan  O
Association  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
interior  O
is  O
pretty  O
dark  O
so  O
pardon  O
me  O
for  O
the  O
poor  O
quality  O
photos  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
good  O
using  O
my  O
flash  O
as  O
the  O
table  O
were  O
quite  O
close  O
to  O
one  O
another  O
not  O
to  O
mention  O
the  O
dimly  O
lit  O
environment  O
.  O

Upon  O
sitting  O
down  O
,  O
we  O
werepresented  O
with  O
the  O
6  O
course  O
dinner  O
set  O
menu  O
(  O
$  O
63.80++  O
per  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
this  O
isdifferent  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
practice  O
of  O
restaurants  O
where  O
they  O
prefer  O
you  O
to  O
order  O
from  O
their  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
as  O
the  O
profit  O
margin  O
is  O
higher.Nevertheless  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
is  O
availableon  O
request.After  O
comparing  O
the  O
2menus  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
diner  O
set  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Chef  O
Starter  O
4/5  O
Before  O
starting  O
our  O
6  O
course  O
meal  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
give  O
watermelon  O
shooter  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
test  O
tube  O
to  O
whet  O
our  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
Chef  O
Starter  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
item  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
that  O
were  O
not  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
.  O

The  O
Chef  O
Starter  O
comprised  O
of  O
a  O
trio  O
which  O
for  O
me  O
the  O
most  O
memorable  O
was  O
the  O
pan  O
seared  O
scallop  O
with  O
asparagus  O
and  O
truffle  O
foam  O
.  O

Oyster  O
3  O
Ways  O
3.5/5  O
For  O
the  O
cold  O
dish  O
there  O
were  O
4  O
choices  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Alaskan  O
King  O
Crab  O
with  O
Homemade  O
Karashi  O
Dressing  O
while  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Oyster  O
3  O
Ways  O
.  O

The  O
oysters  O
were  O
fresh  O
and  O
fat  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
3  O
styles  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
oyster  O
shooter  O
with  O
quail  O
egg  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
afraid  O
that  O
therawnesswill  O
be  O
too  O
much  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
stomach  O
but  O
there  O
was  O
an  O
interesting  O
zesty  O
sauce  O
that  O
brought  O
it  O
together  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
3/5  O
Out  O
of  O
the  O
5  O
choices  O
available  O
for  O
the  O
Side  O
Dish  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
confit  O
with  O
Pork  O
Cracker  O
&  O
Passion  O
Fruit  O
Sauce  O
while  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
,  O
Balsamico  O
Reduction  O
&  O
Cheese  O
Focaccia  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
quite  O
enjoyed  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
lost  O
its  O
shine  O
in  O
the  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
felt  O
like  O
having  O
deep  O
fried  O
wanton  O
with  O
minced  O
pork  O
filling  O
.  O

Crab  O
Bisque  O
Cappuccino  O
4.2/5  O
Next  O
for  O
the  O
soup  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
another  O
4  O
choices  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Miso  O
with  O
Yuzu  O
Essence  O
while  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Crab  O
Bisque  O
Cappuccino  O
w  O
Truffle  O
Foam  O
&  O
Prawn  O
Twister  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
presentation  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
richness  O
and  O
robustness  O
of  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Jawl  O
4.2/5  O
For  O
the  O
Main  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
6  O
choices  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
popular  O
48  O
Hours  O
Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
on  O
Hoba  O
Leaf  O
with  O
Madeira  O
Sauce  O
on  O
Lava  O
Stone  O
and  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Jawl  O
in  O
Pistachio  O
Puree  O
with  O
Pickled  O
Zucchini  O
&  O
64  O
Degree  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
cheek  O
was  O
fork  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
flavourful  O
encrusting  O
and  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
egg  O
yolk  O
coating  O
.  O

You  O
may  O
wonder  O
where  O
is  O
my  O
sixth  O
course  O
,  O
Dessert  O
?  O

Well  O
we  O
did  O
have  O
it  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
after  O
a  O
longwait  O
and  O
I  O
forgot  O
to  O
take  O
photo  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Anyway  O
there  O
are  O
5  O
choices  O
and  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
Chocolate  O
Lava  O
with  O
Raspberry  O
&  O
Homemade  O
Gelato  O
and  O
Madeira  O
Cheese  O
Panna  O
Cotta  O
.  O

Will  O
I  O
ever  O
come  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
again  O
?  O

Yes  O
I  O
will  O
.  O

Although  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
at  O
least  O
4  O
choices  O
for  O
each  O
course  O
.  O

Not  O
only  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
meticulous  O
and  O
exquisite  O
.  O

The  O
service  O
is  O
also  O
top  O
notch  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
moment  O
of  O
lapse  O
of  O
our  O
dessert  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
complaining  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
20  O
%  O
discount  O
for  O
the  O
mistake  O
.  O

After  O
our  O
restaurant  O
week  O
's  O
lunch  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O
Cuisine  O
and  O
ice  O
cream  O
at  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
,  O
Nicole  O
,  O
Kimberley  O
and  O
meended  O
up  O
at  O
Truffs  O
in  O
Telok  O
Ayer  O
.  O

Our  O
initial  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
closed  O
for  O
maintenance  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
really  O
disappointed  O
as  O
we  O
have  O
braved  O
the  O
hot  O
soaring  O
sun  O
walking  O
from  O
Raffles  O
Place  O
to  O
Telok  O
Ayer  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
moment  O
of  O
emptiness  O
in  O
us  O
until  O
Kimberley  O
suggested  O
Truffs  O
whichis  O
just  O
a  O
few  O
steps  O
away  O
.  O

Thank  O
god  O
we  O
have  O
chocolate  O
to  O
cheer  O
us  O
up  O
after  O
the  O
disappointment  O
at  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
(  O
closed  O
for  O
maintenance  O
)  O
.  O

Truff  O
is  O
located  O
on  O
the  O
second  O
floor  O
on  O
the  O
same  O
stretch  O
of  O
shophouses  O
with  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
but  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
door  O
steps  O
away  O
.  O

Kimberley  O
knows  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
because  O
she  O
bought  O
her  O
boyfriend  O
's  O
birthday  O
cake  O
from  O
Truffs  O
but  O
back  O
then  O
it  O
was  O
only  O
a  O
takeaway  O
kiosk  O
.  O

Truffs  O
has  O
since  O
expanded  O
with  O
a  O
sit  O
down  O
area  O
cum  O
gallery  O
where  O
patrons  O
can  O
enjoy  O
their  O
drinks  O
and  O
indulge  O
in  O
their  O
signature  O
cakes  O
and  O
tarts  O
.  O

Ice  O
Chocolate  O
4.2/5  O
Hot  O
Chocolate  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
think  O
this  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
chocolate  O
beverage  O
I  O
ever  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Hot  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
while  O
the  O
ladies  O
had  O
the  O
Ice  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
beverages  O
were  O
velvety  O
,  O
rich  O
but  O
yet  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

The  O
ice  O
chocolate  O
even  O
comes  O
with  O
dark  O
chocolate  O
bits  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Cake  O
4.5/5  O
I  O
am  O
grateful  O
that  O
Truffsnow  O
has  O
a  O
caf  O
area  O
so  O
I  O
gota  O
chance  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
delicious  O
Chocolate  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
11  O
per  O
slice  O
)  O
.  O

When  O
they  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
caf  O
area  O
,  O
one  O
needs  O
to  O
buy  O
the  O
whole  O
cake  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
taste  O
this  O
delicious  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
fluffy  O
and  O
spongy  O
while  O
the  O
ganache  O
was  O
rich  O
but  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
harmonised  O
balance  O
thatI  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
sick  O
finishing  O
it  O
.  O

Earl  O
Grey  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
4/5  O
The  O
tart  O
at  O
Truffs  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
bottom  O
shell  O
but  O
replaced  O
with  O
a  O
crumbly  O
crusts  O
.  O

The  O
tart  O
comes  O
in  O
either  O
Earl  O
Grey  O
or  O
Espresso  O
infused  O
chocolate  O
ganache  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Earl  O
Grey  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
7  O
)  O
which  O
hasa  O
brilliant  O
combination  O
of  O
the  O
intense  O
and  O
velvety  O
tea  O
infused  O
chocolate  O
ganache  O
.  O

Truffs  O
is  O
definitely  O
a  O
chocolate  O
heaven  O
for  O
chocolate  O
lovers  O
for  O
their  O
exquisite  O
truffles  O
,  O
cakes  O
and  O
tarts  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
caf  O
area  O
is  O
rather  O
spacious  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
owner  O
did  O
not  O
fill  O
up  O
the  O
space  O
with  O
more  O
tables  O
and  O
seats  O
to  O
make  O
more  O
profit  O
.  O

The  O
caf  O
area  O
has  O
a  O
quiet  O
and  O
laid  O
back  O
charm  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
imagine  O
myself  O
relaxing  O
,  O
reading  O
a  O
book  O
while  O
sipping  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
hot  O
chocolate  O
.  O

.  O

The  O
Milk  O
flavour  O
was  O
pretty  O
normal  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
chocolate  O
chunks  O
and  O
nuts  O
to  O
give  O
the  O

an  O
enjoyable  O
bites  O

My  O
previous  O
visit  O
to  O
Azur  O
was  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
ago  O
for  O
a  O
corporate  O
lunch  O
when  O
Crowne  O
Plaza  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
was  O
newly  O
built  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
was  O
quite  O
extensive  O
showcasing  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
local  O
favourites  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Azur  O
at  O
Crowne  O
Plaza  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
their  O
new  O
Weekend  O
Changi  O
Brunch  O
menu  O
.  O

Azur  O
has  O
brought  O
together  O
the  O
best  O
of  O
the  O
East  O
and  O
West  O
in  O
a  O
refreshed  O
menu  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
Weekend  O
Changi  O
Brunch  O
featuring  O
local  O
and  O
international  O
cuisines  O
.  O

German  O
Sausages  O
with  O
Juniper  O

4.5/5  O
One  O
of  O
the  O
memorable  O
items  O
I  O
tried  O
at  O
the  O
brunch  O
buffet  O
is  O
the  O
German  O
Sausages  O
with  O
Juniper  O
Berry  O
Sauerkraut  O
and  O
Beef  O
Jus  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
sauerkraut  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
have  O
combination  O
for  O
eating  O
sausages  O
.  O

Some  O
restaurants  O
only  O
served  O
sausages  O
with  O
mustard  O
.  O

Iam  O
delight  O
that  O
Azur  O
took  O
the  O
effort  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
juniper  O
berry  O
sauerkraut  O
.  O

Baked  O

You  O

They  O
were  O

with  O

.  O

3/5  O
The  O
Pan  O
Seared  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
was  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
Yuzu  O
Orange  O
Sauce  O
.  O

The  O

a  O
street  O
in  O
Western  O
Australia  O
opened  O
its  O
door  O
about  O
2  O
months  O
back  O
.  O

The  O

by  O
a  O

from  O

to  O

my  O

I  O
do  O
n't  O
like  O
my  O
coffee  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
acidic  O
hence  O
I  O
quite  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
cup  O
of  O
coffee  O
at  O
Rokeby  O
which  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
bitter  O
for  O
some  O
.  O

All  O

hence  O
it  O
is  O
a  O

ofinjustice  O
to  O
the  O

in  O
this  O

can  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
Full  O
Monty  O
Brekkie  O
(  O
$  O
17.90  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
2  O
eggs  O

For  O
the  O
light-eaters  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
French  O
Toast  O
(  O
$  O
7.90  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
2  O
eggs  O
on  O
toast  O
served  O
with  O
salad  O
and  O
baked  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Ham  O
and  O
Cheese  O
Omelette  O
3.5/5  O
Actually  O
my  O
friend  O
and  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
order  O
the  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
but  O
after  O
taking  O
our  O
orders  O
,  O
the  O
waitress  O
came  O
back  O
5  O
minutes  O
later  O
informing  O
us  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
poached  O
eggs  O
,  O
asking  O
us  O
to  O
change  O
to  O
scrambled  O
egg  O
or  O
other  O
style  O
of  O
eggs  O
for  O
our  O
egg  O
benedict  O
?  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
quite  O
weird  O
since  O
the  O
kitchen  O
can  O
prepare  O
other  O
styles  O
of  O
egg  O
but  O
not  O
poached  O
egg  O
.  O

Anyway  O
my  O
friend  O
changed  O
her  O
order  O
and  O
had  O
the  O
Ham  O
and  O
Cheese  O
Omelette  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
that  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
salad  O
,  O
baked  O
beans  O
and  O
toast  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Vegemite  O
Downunder  O
3.8/5  O
What  O
is  O
egg  O
benedict  O
without  O
poached  O
eggs  O
so  O
I  O
also  O
changed  O
my  O
order  O
to  O
Vegemite  O
Downunder  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
.  O

This  O
brought  O
back  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
childhood  O
memories  O
when  O
I  O
used  O
to  O
spread  O
my  O
toast  O
with  O
vegemite  O
.  O

Paired  O
with  O
the  O
creamy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
with  O
salad  O
and  O
baked  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
hearty  O
breakfast  O
the  O
Aussie  O
way  O
.  O

The  O
brunch  O
menu  O
at  O
Rokeby  O
is  O
pretty  O
decent  O
but  O
service  O
was  O
pretty  O
slow  O
.  O

Considering  O
the  O
kitchen  O
is  O
pretty  O
small  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
only  O
2  O
months  O
into  O
operations  O
,  O
hopefully  O
it  O
can  O
only  O
get  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
bistro  O
and  O
try  O
their  O
mains  O
when  O
operations  O
are  O
smooth  O
running  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
plan  O
to  O
make  O
any  O
reservation  O
for  O
this  O
year  O
Restaurant  O
Week  O
March  O
2013  O
since  O
I  O
felt  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
offered  O
in  O
Restaurant  O
Week  O
werecompromised  O
.  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
I  O
end  O
up  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O
Cuisine  O
?  O

If  O
I  O
remembered  O
correctly  O
,  O
it  O
all  O
started  O
with  O
Daniel  O
tweeting  O
his  O
restaurant  O
week  O
's  O
experience  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O
Cuisine  O
.  O

That  O
started  O
a  O
chain  O
of  O
conversations  O
on  O
Twitter  O
with  O
some  O
friends  O
and  O
eventually  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
making  O
reservation  O
for  O
a  O
weekday  O
lunch  O
with  O
Charleen  O
,  O
Nicole  O
and  O
Kimberley  O
.  O

Carpaccio  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
4.5/5  O
For  O
the  O
starter  O
,  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Carpaccio  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
in  O
Tartate  O
Style  O
.  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
beautiful  O
marbled  O
wagyu  O
beef  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
medley  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
accentuated  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
.  O

Cold  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
4.8/5  O
The  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Cold  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
which  O
was  O
a  O
rendition  O
of  O
their  O
signature  O
Cold  O
Angel  O
Hair  O
Pasta  O
with  O
Oscietra  O
Caviar  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
cold  O
plate  O
.  O

The  O
cold  O
plate  O
simply  O
shows  O
the  O
details  O
the  O
chef  O
has  O
put  O
into  O
his  O
dish  O
.  O

Even  O
without  O
the  O
caviar  O
which  O
was  O
substituted  O
with  O
tomato  O
,  O
mozzarella  O
and  O
ham  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
nothing  O
shy  O
of  O
excellent  O
.  O

Pan-Roasted  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
4.5/5  O
For  O
an  O
additional  O
$  O
15  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Pan  O
Roasted  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
which  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
almond  O
bits  O
.  O

The  O
crunchy  O
almond  O
bits  O
not  O
only  O
given  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
a  O
nice  O
contrast  O
in  O
texture  O
,  O
it  O
also  O
given  O
it  O
a  O
nutty  O
flavour  O
that  O
lifted  O
the  O
whole  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
the  O
delicacy  O
.  O

Pork  O
Ribs  O
in  O
Provencale  O
Style  O
4.8/5  O
Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
main  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
awesome  O
pork  O
ribs  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
had  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
while  O
.  O

The  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
done  O
in  O
Provencale  O
Style  O
was  O
so  O
tender  O
and  O
full  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
the  O
huge  O
slab  O
itself  O
was  O
not  O
enough  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
simply  O
go  O
for  O
another  O
piece  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Brittany  O
Cod  O
Fish  O
,  O
Couscous  O
of  O
Vegetables  O
4/5  O
For  O
the  O
other  O
main  O
,  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Brittany  O
Cod  O
Fish  O
with  O
Couscous  O
of  O
Vegetables  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
milder  O
in  O
taste  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O
bold  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
pork  O
ribs  O
.  O

The  O
delicately  O
cooked  O
piece  O
of  O
cod  O
fish  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
smokiness  O
.  O

English  O
Breakfast  O
Tea  O
Bavarois  O
4/5  O
For  O
the  O
dessert  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
not  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
and  O
was  O
served  O
the  O
English  O
Breakfast  O
Tea  O
Bavarois  O
.  O

The  O
flavourful  O
custard  O
set  O
with  O
gelatine  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
lingering  O
tea  O
taste  O
that  O
was  O
complemented  O
by  O
the  O
salty  O
caramel  O
and  O
lemongrass  O
infused  O
sauce  O
.  O

Petit  O
Fours  O
3.8/5  O
For  O
the  O
Petit  O
Fours  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Almond  O
Cracker  O
,  O
Madeleine  O
and  O
Dark  O
Chocolate  O
Praline  O
.  O

Pardon  O
my  O
ignorance  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
puzzled  O
,  O
there  O
was  O
only  O
3  O
items  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
right  O
?  O

Paired  O
with  O
my  O
coffee  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
nevertheless  O
a  O
simple  O
yet  O
perfect  O
end  O
to  O
a  O
memorable  O
lunch  O
.  O

I  O

I  O

it  O

Now  O
I  O

Singaporean  O
prefers  O
fried  O
stuff  O
which  O
is  O
why  O
there  O
was  O
mix  O
opinions  O
with  O
the  O
Pan  O
Fried  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
(  O

at  O

Some  O
of  O
us  O
prefer  O
the  O
fried  O
style  O
where  O
the  O
carrot  O
cake  O
is  O
more  O
crisp  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
the  O
opposite  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
my  O
carrot  O
cake  O
steamed  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
pan  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
was  O
well  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
layer  O
of  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
was  O
still  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
with  O
shreds  O
of  O
radish  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Egg  O
Cake  O
4.8/5  O
Resembling  O
the  O
Chinese  O
Steamed  O
Cake  O
(  O
Huat  O
Kueh  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3.80  O
for  O
1pc  O
)  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

A  O
distinct  O
egg  O
taste  O
which  O
felt  O
like  O
eating  O
Tamago  O
while  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
spongy  O
like  O
a  O
cake  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
eaten  O
anything  O
like  O
it  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
Pig  O
's  O
Liver  O
4/5  O
A  O
bold  O
twist  O
from  O
the  O
tradition  O
where  O
vermicelli  O
roll  O
is  O
commonly  O
stuffed  O
with  O
char  O
siew  O
or  O
shrimp  O
,  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Roll  O
with  O
Pig  O
's  O
Liver  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
velvety  O
texture  O
while  O
the  O
fresh  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
soft  O
.  O

Another  O
dim  O
sum  O
dish  O
that  O
you  O
will  O
not  O
find  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
Chef  O
Mak  O
mentioned  O
in  O
one  O
of  O
his  O
interviews  O
,  O
he  O
has  O
tested  O
the  O
local  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
until  O
he  O
was  O
satisfied  O
with  O
the  O
texture  O
although  O
there  O
is  O
still  O
a  O
slight  O
different  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
's  O
pig  O
's  O
liver  O
which  O
is  O
even  O
more  O
tender  O
.  O

Baked  O

Pork  O

The  O
marquee  O
dish  O
of  O
Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
that  O
has  O
transformed  O
the  O
eatery  O
into  O
a  O

the  O
famed  O

Bun  O
with  O

(  O

)  O
.  O

Everyone  O
on  O
our  O
table  O
was  O
eagerly  O
waiting  O
for  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
.  O

I  O
already  O
have  O
the  O
expectation  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
good  O
but  O
sinking  O
my  O
teeth  O
into  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
way  O
beyond  O
my  O
description  O
of  O
just  O
good  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
excellently  O
awesome  O
.  O

Even  O
those  O
that  O
have  O
tried  O
the  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
's  O
branch  O
gave  O
the  O
thumbs  O
up  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
exterior  O
of  O
the  O
bun  O
was  O
crumbly  O
and  O
pillowy  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
boasted  O
a  O
sweet-salty  O
taste  O
of  O
oozing  O
barbecued  O
pork  O
.  O

Yes  O
I  O
loving  O
it  O
so  O
much  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
giving  O
it  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O

with  O
BBQ  O

(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
the  O

paired  O
excellently  O
with  O
the  O

Dumpling  O
Teochew  O

4.2/5  O
I  O
ended  O
up  O
eating  O
the  O
Dumpling  O
Teochew  O
Style  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
for  O
3pc  O
)  O
myself  O
because  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
at  O
my  O
table  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
the  O
Chinese  O
chives  O
in  O
the  O
dumpling  O
.  O

Maybe  O
because  O
I  O
am  O
a  O
Teochew  O
,  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
deft  O
piece  O
of  O
work  O
redolent  O
of  O
both  O
the  O
Soon  O

and  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
or  O
Har  O
Gow  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
was  O
extremely  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
patrons  O
.  O

The  O
thin  O
and  O
translucent  O
skin  O
was  O
smooth  O
but  O
yet  O
sturdy  O
wrapping  O
the  O
succulent  O
prawn  O
which  O
was  O
so  O
addictive  O
that  O
we  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
item  O
to  O
be  O
sold  O
out  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

Pork  O
Dumpling  O
with  O

3.5/5  O
The  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shrimp  O
or  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
was  O
delicately  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
balancedproportion  O
of  O
ground  O
pork  O
and  O
shrimp  O
.  O

While  O
others  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
saltiness  O
which  O
I  O
covered  O
by  O
dipping  O
into  O
the  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
.  O

Beef  O

with  O
Beancurd  O
Skin  O
(  O
$  O
4.20  O

was  O
probably  O
the  O
least  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
majority  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
at  O
my  O
table  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
beef  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
taste  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
mild  O
for  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
Spring  O
Roll  O
with  O
Egg  O
White  O
(  O
$  O
4.20  O

is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O

.  O

Deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
beautiful  O
golden  O
brown  O
,  O
the  O
spring  O
roll  O
was  O
crispy  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
complemented  O
with  O
the  O
creamy  O
egg  O

filling  O
.  O

expect  O

Osmanthus  O
Cake  O
(  O

for  O
3  O

which  O
was  O
gelatinous  O
and  O
not  O
overpowering  O
sweet  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
helped  O
to  O
cleanse  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Since  O

This  O
is  O
possible  O
all  O
thanks  O
to  O
the  O
Knorr  O

.  O

If  O
not  O
for  O
it  O
,  O
more  O
time  O
would  O
be  O
needed  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
Tom  O
Yam  O

and  O
stock  O
.  O

The  O
dish  O
smelled  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
we  O
asked  O
the  O
organiser  O
whether  O
we  O
can  O
have  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
rice  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

After  O
Chef  O
Daniel  O
's  O
demonstration  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
our  O
time  O
to  O
cook  O
our  O
own  O
family  O
recipe  O
dish  O
.  O

Vicki  O
and  O
me  O
has  O
been  O
brainstorming  O
for  O
a  O
simple  O
dish  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
handle  O
within  O
our  O
culinary  O
ability  O
.  O

After  O
consulting  O
with  O
Vicki  O
's  O
mum  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
cook  O
Golden  O
Sands  O
French  O
Beans  O
.  O

We  O
even  O
practiced  O
the  O
dish  O
the  O
night  O
before  O
so  O
that  O
we  O
do  O
n't  O
make  O
a  O
fool  O
of  O
ourselves  O
in  O
the  O
blogger  O
cookout  O
session  O
.  O

Everything  O
turned  O
out  O
pretty  O
well  O
and  O
we  O
even  O
learnt  O
some  O
tips  O
from  O
Chef  O
Daniel  O
.  O

Thanks  O
for  O
his  O
guidance  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
noticed  O
a  O
crowd  O
at  O
Song  O
Kee  O
Fishball  O
Noodle  O
along  O
Upper  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
whenever  O
I  O
am  O
on  O
my  O
way  O
home  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

Managed  O
to  O
ask  O
a  O
friend  O
who  O
stays  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
one  O
evening  O
to  O
join  O
me  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
place  O
around  O
1130pm  O
,  O
the  O
place  O
was  O
already  O
pretty  O
crowded  O
with  O
many  O
tables  O
waiting  O
for  O
their  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
30  O
minutes  O
and  O
indeed  O
I  O
did  O
.  O

Mee  O
Kia  O
Dry  O
4/5  O
We  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
Mee  O
Kia  O
Dry  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
and  O
Mee  O
Pok  O
Dry  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
.  O

Each  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
came  O
with  O
3  O
fishballs  O
,  O
a  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
(  O
Her  O
Giao  O
)  O
and  O
a  O
Tao  O
Pok  O
stuffed  O
with  O
fish  O
paste  O
.  O

The  O
noodles  O
and  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
were  O
rather  O
normal  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
their  O
ingredients  O
and  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
pork  O
lard  O
.  O

Mee  O
Pok  O
Dry  O
4/5  O
The  O
fishball  O
that  O
is  O
about  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
a  O
ping  O
pong  O
ball  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
yellowtail  O
.  O

The  O
fishball  O
was  O
springy  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
(  O
Her  O
Giao  O
)  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

Biting  O
into  O
the  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
,  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
shallot  O
oil  O
from  O
the  O
filling  O
simply  O
filled  O
the  O
whole  O
mouth  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
visit  O
I  O
can  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
them  O
in  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
been  O
observing  O
but  O
still  O
ca  O
n't  O
figure  O
out  O
why  O
the  O
uncle  O
takes  O
so  O
long  O
to  O
cook  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
.  O

His  O
motion  O
was  O
pretty  O
fast  O
and  O
it  O
does  O
n't  O
seem  O
to  O
have  O
unnecessary  O
action  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
visit  O
Song  O
Kee  O
Fishball  O
Noodle  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
crowd  O
,  O
proceed  O
to  O
make  O
your  O
order  O
and  O
take  O
a  O
queue  O
number  O
first  O
before  O
finding  O
a  O
seat  O
.  O

The  O
wait  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
long  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
drinks  O
you  O
can  O
take  O
it  O
yourself  O
from  O
the  O
fridge  O
first  O
.  O

Just  O
pay  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
noodle  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
.  O

the  O

around  O

Michael  O
Hadley  O
from  O
Michelangelo  O
together  O
with  O

Original  O
Sin  O
and  O
since  O
then  O
never  O
look  O
back  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
really  O
quite  O
an  O
achievement  O
for  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
restaurant  O
in  O
the  O
current  O
F  O
&  O
B  O
scene  O
where  O
restaurants  O
opened  O
and  O
closed  O
in  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O

Principessa  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
colorful  O
salad  O
garden  O
,  O
Principessa  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
has  O
an  O
eclectic  O
mix  O
of  O
roasted  O
pumpkin  O
,  O
avocado  O
,  O
asparagus  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
and  O
boccocini  O
,  O
all  O
mingled  O
in  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
mixed  O
lettuces  O
and  O
dressed  O
in  O
a  O
light  O
balsamic  O
vinaigrette  O
that  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
unassuming  O
.  O

Basilico  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
Basilico  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
is  O
homemade  O
herb  O
bread  O
with  O
creamy  O
goat  O
cheese  O
,  O
char  O
grilled  O
eggplant  O
and  O
roasted  O
capsicum  O
and  O
rocket  O
leaves  O
.  O

The  O
bruschetta  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
balanced  O
of  O
flavours  O
that  O
will  O
whet  O
your  O
appetite  O
.  O

Fritters  O
3/5  O
The  O
Eggplant  O
and  O
Parsnip  O
Fritters  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
drizzled  O
with  O
zesty  O
house  O
mayo  O
was  O
rather  O
simple  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
batter  O
but  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
quite  O
delectable  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
exterior  O
crisp  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
parsnip  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
texture  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
potato  O
,  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Haloumi  O
3/5  O
The  O
Haloumi  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
usually  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
goat  O
's  O
milk  O
and  O
sheep  O
's  O
milk  O
was  O
nicely  O
pan  O
fried  O
and  O
served  O
on  O
a  O

of  O

greens  O
,  O
roasted  O
capsicum  O
,  O
lentil  O
,  O
cucumber  O
and  O
mint  O
salad  O
.  O

Due  O
to  O
its  O
high  O
melting  O
point  O
,  O
the  O
haloumi  O
is  O
ideal  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
pan  O
fried  O
or  O
grilled  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O
texture  O
and  O
alternate  O
way  O
to  O
enjoy  O

The  O
new  O
concept  O
of  O
Japanese-Italian  O
cafe  O
by  O
MOF  O
sounds  O
interestingly  O
but  O
most  O
the  O
items  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
are  O
still  O
vastly  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
inspired  O
.  O

Nothing  O
really  O
unique  O
in  O
their  O
dishes  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
or  O
tried  O
in  O
other  O
local  O
restaurants/cafes  O
,  O
probably  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
bird  O
cages  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
pretty  O
good  O
and  O
worth  O
a  O
visit  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
their  O
savoury  O
more  O
than  O
their  O
sweet  O
stuff  O
.  O

checked  O
this  O
new  O
noodle  O

.  O

It  O

Opened  O
in  O
February  O
2013  O
by  O
a  O
duo  O
trained  O
in  O
Shatec  O
,  O
the  O
pair  O
of  O
noodles  O
lovers  O
created  O
their  O
very  O
own  O
local  O
style  O
Singapore  O
ramen  O
,  O
gourmet  O
quality  O
noodles  O
at  O
hawker  O
prices  O
using  O
modern  O
culinary  O
techniques  O
and  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
.  O

A  O
bowl  O
of  O
the  O
noodle  O
costs  O
$  O
5/  O
$  O
6/  O
$  O
7  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
really  O
quite  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
consider  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
ingredients  O
that  O
come  O
with  O
the  O
noodle  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
Singapore  O
style  O
ramen  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Style  O
Wonton  O
,  O
Freshly  O
Sliced  O
Scallions  O
,  O
Cha  O
Su  O
,  O
Crispy  O
Potato  O
Wrapped  O
Prawn  O
,  O
Hot  O
Spring  O
Egg  O
and  O
of  O
course  O
the  O
Springy  O
Noodles  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
the  O
stall  O
was  O
using  O
Wu  O
Hua  O
Rou  O
for  O
their  O
Cha  O
Su  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
2  O
weeks  O
for  O
the  O
leaner  O
meat  O
but  O
will  O
be  O
switching  O
back  O
to  O
pork  O
belly  O
for  O
its  O
aroma  O
and  O
tenderness  O
.  O

The  O
crispy  O
potato  O
wrapped  O
prawn  O
is  O
quite  O
unique  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
having  O
fried  O
prawn  O
wrapped  O
by  O
rosti  O
.  O

Singapore  O
Style  O
Ramen  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
stall  O
has  O
created  O
this  O
simple  O
yet  O
complicated  O
dish  O
specially  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

It  O
is  O
because  O
the  O
simplest  O
dish  O
to  O
make  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
most  O
complicated  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
it  O
is  O
either  O
you  O
hate  O
it  O
or  O
like  O
it  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

The  O
reason  O
is  O
the  O
noodle  O
.  O

In  O
terms  O
of  O
texture  O
the  O
thin  O
noodles  O
really  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
springy  O
and  O
enjoyable  O
texture  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
has  O
an  O
alkaline  O
taste  O
that  O
was  O
still  O
acceptable  O
to  O
me  O
but  O
may  O
not  O
for  O
many  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
still  O
pretty  O
new  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
going  O
through  O
refinement  O
and  O
adjustment  O
of  O
the  O
ultimate  O
noodle  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
for  O
the  O
stall  O
to  O
achieve  O
the  O
dream  O
of  O
serving  O
their  O
Singapore  O
style  O
ramen  O
not  O
only  O
to  O
the  O
locals  O
but  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
world  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
super  O
belated  O
post  O
.  O

Last  O
Christmas  O
,  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
us  O
went  O
to  O
Batam  O
for  O
our  O
annual  O
Christmas  O
gathering  O
.  O

My  O
friend  O
suggested  O
Montigo  O
Resorts  O
Nongsa  O
in  O
Batam  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
heard  O
of  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
know  O
of  O
Harris  O
and  O
Holiday  O
Inn  O
Hotel  O
.  O

Apparently  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
a  O
new  O
property  O
about  O
a  O
year  O
old  O
labeling  O
itself  O
as  O
5  O
stars  O
luxury  O
resort  O
in  O
Batam  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
check  O
in  O
lobby  O
of  O
Montigo  O
Resorts  O
Nongsa  O
Batam  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
is  O
really  O
beautiful  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
see  O
Singapore  O
across  O
the  O
sea  O
and  O
even  O
spotted  O
Marina  O
Bay  O
Sands  O
.  O

A  O
map  O
of  O
the  O
resort  O
.  O

The  O
villas  O
are  O
all  O
built  O
along  O
the  O
1  O
kilometer  O
stretch  O
of  O
private  O
beach  O
facing  O
the  O
South  O
China  O
Sea  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
private  O
beach  O
is  O
still  O
not  O
fully  O
completed  O
when  O
we  O
were  O
there  O
.  O

The  O
beach  O
and  O
water  O
was  O
muddy  O
.  O

Upon  O
checking  O
in  O
,  O
we  O
are  O
transported  O
to  O
our  O
3  O
storey  O
villa  O
by  O
buddy  O
.  O

The  O
first  O
floor  O
considers  O
of  O
the  O
living  O
hall  O
,  O
a  O
toilet  O
,  O
a  O
kitchen  O
bar  O
,  O
balcony  O
and  O
pool  O
.  O

Balcony  O
area  O
with  O
an  O
infinity  O
pool  O
facing  O
the  O
sea  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
2  O
bedrooms  O
on  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
master  O
bedroom  O
which  O
is  O
really  O
spacious  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
view  O
from  O
the  O
master  O
bedroom  O
.  O

The  O
left  O
side  O
is  O
the  O
spa  O
villa  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photography  O
,  O
the  O
private  O
beach  O
is  O
still  O
under  O
construction  O
and  O
muddy  O
.  O

The  O
toilet  O
is  O
very  O
spacious  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
half  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
the  O
bedroom  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
bath  O
tub  O
was  O
quite  O
dirty  O
so  O
I  O
never  O
used  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
bedroom  O
is  O
smaller  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
twin  O
beds  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
an  O
in  O
room  O
toilet  O
and  O
tv  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
top  O
floor  O
is  O
the  O
sky  O
terrace  O
.  O

In  O
front  O
is  O
the  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
sea  O
while  O
the  O
back  O
are  O
the  O
hillside  O
villas  O
.  O

The  O
design  O
of  O
Montigo  O
Resorts  O
Nongsa  O
is  O
really  O
nice  O
and  O
the  O
place  O
is  O
beautiful  O
.  O

It  O
does  O
n't  O
feel  O
like  O
I  O
am  O
in  O
Batam  O
at  O
all  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
like  O
I  O
am  O
somewhere  O
in  O
Phuket  O
or  O
Bali  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
basically  O
nothing  O
at  O
Nongsa  O
area  O
and  O
its  O
about  O
an  O
hour  O
drive  O
to  O
Batam  O
City  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
suitable  O
for  O
a  O
nice  O
romantic  O
weekend  O
or  O
getaway  O
from  O
the  O
hustle  O
life  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
also  O
a  O
lot  O
to  O
be  O
desired  O
on  O
their  O
housekeeping  O
and  O
maintenance  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
year  O
old  O
property  O
,  O
the  O
place  O
is  O
considered  O
quite  O
dirty  O
and  O
worn  O
.  O

The  O
private  O
beach  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
ready  O
yet  O
.  O

a  O

twist  O
to  O

Accordingly  O
to  O

supposed  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
royal  O

of  O

the  O

cooked  O
in  O

Bibimbap  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
signature  O
item  O
at  O
Bibigo  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
their  O
Bibimbap  O
which  O
means  O
mixed  O
rice  O
in  O
Korean  O
.  O

Basically  O
the  O
menu  O
offers  O
3  O
types  O
of  O
bibimbap  O
set  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
rice  O
(  O
white  O
rice  O
,  O
black  O
rice  O
,  O
brown  O
white  O
,  O
barley  O
&  O
white  O
)  O
,  O
topping  O
(  O
char  O
grilled  O
bulgogi  O
,  O
chicken  O
teriyaki  O
,  O
chicken  O
breast  O
,  O
grilled  O
spicy  O
pork  O
,  O
tofu  O
)  O
and  O
sauce  O
(  O
kohot  O
,  O
citron  O
soy  O
,  O
green  O
sesame  O
,  O
ssam  O
)  O
.  O

One  O
can  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
to  O
their  O
own  O
preference  O
.  O

The  O
Bibimbap  O
set  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
traditional  O
mixed  O
rice  O
with  O
assorted  O
vegetables  O
and  O
toppings  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O
.  O

The  O
bibimbap  O
here  O
is  O
improved  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
busy  O
yet  O
healthconsciousdiners  O

Bibigo  O

Bibigo  O
Rice  O
3/5  O
The  O
Bibigo  O
Rice  O
set  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
is  O
a  O
salad  O
type  O
mixed  O
rice  O
with  O
assorted  O
vegetables  O
and  O
toppings  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
vegetables  O
were  O
more  O
than  O
the  O
rice  O
serving  O
.  O

Definitely  O
a  O
healthier  O
option  O
and  O
for  O
those  O
that  O
wants  O
to  O
control  O
their  O
carbo  O
intake  O
.  O

Hot  O
Stone  O
Bibimbap  O
4/5  O
The  O
Hot  O
Stone  O
Bibimbap  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
bibimbap  O
set  O
except  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
hot  O
stone  O
bowl  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
hot  O
stone  O
bibimbap  O
to  O
normal  O
bibimbap  O
and  O
bibigo  O
rice  O
because  O
the  O
rice  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
burnt  O
crisp  O
texture  O
.  O

Among  O
all  O
the  O
combination  O
we  O
tried  O
,  O
the  O
black  O
rice  O
is  O
very  O
memorable  O
.  O

It  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
wild  O
rice  O
used  O
in  O
western  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Hoddeok  O
4/5  O
This  O
is  O
a  O
dessert  O
that  O
we  O
seldom  O
get  O
to  O
eat  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Hoddeok  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
Korean  O
sweet  O
pancake  O
served  O
with  O
cinnamon  O
and  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

The  O
warm  O
pancake  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
sweet  O
and  O
chewy  O
texture  O
that  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Bibigo  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
4/5  O
Made  O
from  O
the  O
black  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
Bibigo  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
crispy  O
rice  O
crust  O
which  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O
combination  O
.  O

It  O
added  O
a  O
nice  O
dimension  O
of  O
enjoying  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

Unlike  O
most  O
Korean  O
restaurants  O
that  O
serves  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
complimentary  O
side  O
dishes  O
,  O
Bibigo  O
does  O
not  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
most  O
meals  O
at  O
Bibigo  O
comes  O
with  O
side  O
servings  O
of  O
authentic  O
kimichi  O
,  O
succulent  O
tofu  O
skins  O
and  O
fresh  O
juicy  O
asparagus  O
to  O
complete  O
the  O
experience  O
of  O
Korean  O
culture  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O

I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
many  O
as  O
I  O
could  O
smell  O
it  O
from  O
a  O

The  O
raw  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
we  O
took  O
the  O

from  O
the  O

dishes  O
to  O

up  O
the  O

This  O

a  O
good  O
sandwich  O
with  O
a  O
rich  O
medley  O
of  O
flavours  O
but  O
the  O
beef  O
was  O
slightly  O
on  O
the  O

looked  O
rather  O
similar  O
is  O
n't  O
it  O
?  O

Individually  O
the  O
pastry  O
was  O
pretty  O
tantalizing  O
and  O
I  O
did  O
go  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

As  O
a  O
whole  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O

The  O
Classic  O
Affogato  O
(  O

was  O
just  O
what  O
I  O
needed  O
for  O
my  O
daily  O
caffeine  O
dose  O
.  O

It  O
just  O
got  O
better  O
with  O
a  O
second  O
dose  O
of  O
ice  O
cream  O
to  O
boast  O
up  O
the  O
dosage  O

I  O
usually  O

for  O
my  O
breakfast  O
but  O
the  O
Yogurt  O
Parfait  O
(  O

)  O
inspired  O
me  O
to  O
try  O
other  O
ways  O
of  O
enjoying  O
it  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
yogurt  O
,  O
peach  O
,  O
banana  O
and  O
granola  O
.  O

Dessert  O
can  O
be  O
healthy  O

simple  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
,  O
Beanstro  O
is  O
just  O
like  O
Coffee  O

or  O
The  O
Connoisseur  O

(  O

.  O

Food  O
wise  O
it  O
is  O
pretty  O
decent  O
and  O
affordable  O
.  O

The  O
fact  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
not  O
many  O
halal  O
certified  O

restaurants  O
in  O

I  O
applaud  O

it  O
to  O
plan  O
on  O
11  O
March  O
2013  O
on  O
a  O
Monday  O
morning  O
.  O

After  O
meeting  O
Tony  O
at  O
8am  O
,  O
he  O
drove  O
us  O
into  O
Johor  O
.  O

Traffic  O
was  O
quite  O
smooth  O
since  O
its  O
a  O
Monday  O
morning  O
and  O
within  O
15  O
minutes  O
we  O
were  O
at  O
the  O
other  O
side  O
of  O
the  O
causeway  O
.  O

Our  O
first  O
stop  O
for  O
breakfast  O
was  O
Bukit  O
Chagar  O
Roti  O
Canai  O
.  O

Roti  O
Canai  O
has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O

24  O

.  O

It  O
only  O
opens  O
in  O
the  O
morning  O
from  O
6am  O
to  O
11am  O
.  O

Usually  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
sold  O
out  O
by  O
10am  O
so  O
be  O
there  O
early  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
both  O
the  O
plain  O
and  O
egg  O
roti  O
canai  O
a  O
total  O
of5  O
pieces  O
which  O
cost  O
us  O
around  O
$  O
8  O
ringgit  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
plain  O
roti  O
canai  O
over  O
the  O
egg  O
one  O
.  O

The  O
roti  O
canai  O
seems  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
thicker  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
one  O
I  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
but  O
yet  O
fluffy  O
and  O
airy  O
inside  O

such  O

Tony  O
has  O
been  O
raving  O
about  O
the  O
famous  O
fried  O
durian  O
fritter  O
so  O
we  O
definitely  O
must  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
try  O
.  O

It  O
seems  O
like  O
Wah  O
Cai  O
has  O
become  O
a  O
little  O
celebrity  O
in  O

being  O

gave  O

I  O

This  O
is  O
beyond  O
awesome  O
!  O

Yes  O
I  O
maybe  O
bias  O
since  O
I  O
love  O
durian  O
but  O
for  O
the  O
durian  O
lovers  O
out  O
there  O
you  O
probably  O
will  O
stand  O
by  O
me  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
real  O
thing  O
using  O
premium  O
durians  O
(  O

D101  O
)  O
that  O
is  O

not  O
stealing  O
the  O

giving  O
it  O
a  O
whole  O

that  O
Kway  O

a  O

For  O

For  O
the  O

,  O
I  O
was  O
wondering  O
what  O
is  O
the  O
difference  O
between  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
ordinary  O
.  O

The  O
radish  O
cake  O
was  O
rather  O
mushy  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
eggs  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
which  O
suits  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

Our  O
last  O
stop  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
was  O
at  O

There  O
were  O
many  O

at  O

but  O
our  O
limited  O
stomach  O
space  O
prevented  O
us  O
from  O
checking  O
them  O
all  O
out  O
.  O

We  O
settled  O

March  O
2013  O
Makansutra  O
dinner  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Tonny  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
used  O
to  O
be  O
at  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
Road  O
and  O
has  O
recently  O
moved  O
into  O
their  O
new  O
premise  O
at  O
Geylang  O
Lorong  O

.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
named  O
after  O
Chef  O
Tonny  O
himself  O
who  O
comes  O
from  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
serving  O
home  O
style  O
Cantonese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Hong  O
Kong  O
Wontons  O
with  O
Spicy  O
Sauce  O
3.5/5  O
Dinner  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Wontons  O
with  O
Spicy  O
Sauce  O
.  O

The  O
wantons  O
were  O
as  O
huge  O
as  O
ping  O
pong  O
balls  O
filled  O
with  O
delectable  O
filling  O
with  O
the  O
thin  O
wanton  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
unfortunately  O
lacked  O
the  O
kick  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
.  O

Panfried  O
Dace  O
Fishcake  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Panfried  O
Dace  O
Fishcake  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
with  O
Lup  O
Cheong  O
(  O
Chinese  O
sausage  O
)  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
.  O

A  O
medley  O
of  O
enjoyable  O
textures  O
and  O
flavours  O
coming  O
together  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Yam  O
with  O
Truffle  O
Oil  O
4.5.5  O
There  O
are  O
2  O
signature  O
dishes  O
at  O
Tonny  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

They  O
are  O
Crouching  O
Tiger  O
Hidden  O
Dragon  O
which  O
is  O
lobster  O
puree  O
cooked  O
with  O
egg  O
white  O
and  O
Crispy  O
Yam  O
with  O
Truffle  O
Oil  O
.  O

Although  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
crouching  O
tiger  O
hidden  O
dragon  O
,  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
crispy  O
yam  O
with  O
truffle  O
oil  O
.  O

Knowing  O
Singaporean  O
's  O
love  O
for  O
yam  O
which  O
is  O
usually  O
served  O
mashed  O
or  O
sliced  O
,  O
Chef  O
Tonny  O
innovated  O
and  O
created  O
this  O
crispy  O
and  O
crunchy  O
yam  O
that  O
was  O
cut  O
into  O
threads  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

A  O
special  O
sauce  O
,  O
sesame  O
and  O
truffle  O
oil  O
is  O
added  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
this  O
dish  O
also  O
makes  O
a  O
good  O
Lunar  O
New  O
Year  O
Lo  O
Hei  O
or  O
Yusheng  O
dish  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Prawns  O
3/5  O
The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Prawns  O
was  O
fresh  O
but  O
quite  O
ordinary  O
.  O

Deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
and  O
golden  O
brown  O
,  O
I  O
even  O
ate  O
it  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
shell  O
.  O

Fried  O
Green  O
Wrasse  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O

Roe  O
4/5  O
The  O
Fried  O
Green  O
Wrasse  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
with  O
Crab  O
Roe  O
was  O
another  O
unique  O
combination  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
crab  O
roe  O
sauce  O
that  O
was  O
drenched  O
over  O
the  O
fish  O
fillet  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
highlight  O
for  O
me  O
was  O
the  O
translucent  O
Fen  O
Pi  O
(  O
)  O
or  O
bean  O
flour  O
sheet  O
made  O
from  O
green  O
bean  O

My  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
it  O
was  O
at  O
Hai  O
Siang  O
Joo  O
Seafood  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

Quite  O
similar  O
to  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
but  O
it  O
is  O
translucent  O
and  O
the  O
texture  O
is  O
firmer  O
.  O

Eggplant  O

over  O
again  O

eggplant  O
.  O

The  O
Eggplant  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Kurobuta  O
Meat  O
is  O
served  O
whole  O
!  O

For  O
those  O
that  O
hate  O
to  O
eat  O
eggplant  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
mushy  O
texture  O
may  O
have  O
a  O
second  O
thought  O
as  O
the  O
whole  O
eggplant  O
is  O
stuffed  O
with  O
delectable  O
kurobuta  O
meat  O
.  O

4/5  O
The  O
French  O
Beans  O
with  O
Homemade  O
Waxed  O
Meat  O
may  O
looked  O
like  O
two  O
different  O
ingredients  O
anyhow  O
puttogetherbut  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
.  O

The  O
2  O
ingredients  O
actually  O
complement  O
each  O
other  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
serving  O
.  O

Claypot  O
Chicken  O
with  O
Chinese  O
Wine  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
Claypot  O
Chicken  O
with  O
Chinese  O
Wine  O
was  O
excellently  O
executed  O
.  O

Not  O
overlysophisticatedbut  O
yet  O
bringing  O
out  O
the  O
best  O
of  O
the  O
ingredient  O
,  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
nicely  O
flavoured  O

there  O

who  O
have  O
eaten  O
at  O
Tonny  O
Restaurant  O
in  O
their  O
previous  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
session  O
told  O
me  O
about  O
the  O
braised  O
duck  O
here  O
hence  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
with  O
Winter  O
Bamboo  O
Shoots  O
indeed  O
was  O
worth  O
the  O
wait  O
for  O
its  O
fragrant  O
and  O
tender  O
meat  O
.  O

Braised  O
Fish  O
Noodles  O
with  O
Goose  O
Liver  O
Paste  O
4.5/5  O
It  O
was  O
a  O
full  O

and  O
the  O
food  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
slow  O
coming  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
kitchen  O
.  O

Some  O
diners  O
at  O
our  O
table  O
wanted  O
to  O
make  O
a  O
move  O
first  O
but  O
the  O
organizers  O
asked  O
them  O
to  O
stay  O
for  O
the  O
Braised  O
Fish  O
Noodles  O
with  O
Goose  O
Liver  O
Paste  O
.  O

Was  O
it  O
worth  O
staying  O
for  O
the  O
noodles  O
?  O

Yes  O
it  O
was  O
!  O

Made  O
with  O
fish  O
meat  O
and  O
flour  O
,  O
the  O
noodles  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
firm  O
and  O
springy  O
texture  O
that  O
was  O
quite  O
beyond  O
my  O
expectation  O
in  O
a  O
good  O
way  O

.  O

Most  O
of  O
the  O

were  O
not  O

Initially  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
sauce  O
for  O
theMushroom  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Noodles  O
Dry  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
was  O
vinegar  O
because  O
of  O
its  O
dark  O
colour  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
special  O
sauce  O
that  O
paired  O
pretty  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
springy  O
noodles  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
is  O
also  O
very  O
generous  O
in  O
the  O
serving  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
slices  O
of  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
lean  O
meat  O
,  O

and  O
minced  O

in  O

I  O
can  O
already  O
smell  O
the  O
fragrant  O
aroma  O

(  O
dried  O

)  O
from  O
the  O

The  O
Mushroom  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Noodles  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
definitely  O
fare  O
much  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
dry  O
one  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
and  O
most  O
flavoursomebak  O

I  O
have  O
ever  O

I  O
even  O

going  O
back  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
definitely  O
going  O

It  O
seems  O
like  O
many  O
Japanese  O
restaurants  O
have  O
been  O
venturing  O
overseas  O
opening  O
new  O
outlets  O
in  O
Singapore.A  O
new  O
Japanese  O
Yakiniku  O
(  O
barbeque  O
)  O
restaurant  O
chain  O
,  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
has  O
chosen  O
Mandarin  O
Gallery  O
in  O
Singapore  O
for  O
it  O
's  O
first  O
ever  O
outlet  O
outside  O
Japan  O
.  O

Ito  O
Kacho  O
is  O
established  O
in  O
2009  O
by  O
Sumikin  O
Bussan  O
(  O
a  O
large  O
Japanese  O
corporation  O
)  O
strived  O
to  O
provide  O
top  O
grade  O
barbequed  O
beef  O
at  O
affordable  O
cost  O
.  O

Jakasei  O
Potato  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O
While  O
waiting  O
for  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
some  O
small  O
bites  O
to  O
fill  O
our  O
hungry  O
stomach  O
.  O

The  O
Jakasei  O
Potato  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
11.80  O
)  O
was  O
presented  O
like  O
a  O
volcano  O
with  O
the  O
bacon  O
resembling  O
lava  O
flowing  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
erupted  O
potato  O
salad  O
mountain  O
.  O

The  O
potato  O
salad  O
itself  O
is  O
already  O
quite  O
nice  O
with  O
a  O
smooth  O
creamy  O
texture  O
with  O
occasional  O
discovery  O
of  O
bite  O
size  O
eggs  O
,  O
carrots  O
and  O
onions  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
bacon  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
redundant  O
except  O
for  O
decorative  O
purpose  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
crisp  O
.  O

Salmon  O
and  O
Cream  O
Cheese  O
Namaharumaki  O
3.8/5  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
took  O
a  O
second  O
look  O
when  O
the  O
Salmon  O
and  O
Cream  O
Cheese  O
Namaharumaki  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
moment  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
have  O
stepped  O
into  O
a  O
Vietnamese  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
rice  O
paper  O
is  O
used  O
in  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
namaharumaki  O
sure  O
whetted  O
up  O
the  O
appetite  O
for  O
more  O
delicious  O
food  O
to  O
come  O
.  O

Ito  O
Kacho  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
was  O
arefreshing  O
salad  O
consisted  O
of  O
lettuce  O
,  O
onion  O
red  O
and  O
yellow  O
pepper  O
,  O
cherry  O
tomato  O
and  O
fried  O
onion  O
.  O

The  O
healthy  O
greens  O
were  O
brought  O
together  O
nicely  O
by  O
the  O
goma  O
sauce  O
making  O
it  O
a  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
dish  O
.  O

Kimchi  O
Moriawase  O
3.5/5  O
Namuru  O
Moriawase  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
next  O
2  O
dishes  O
got  O
me  O
a  O
bit  O
confused  O
.  O

First  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
was  O
in  O
a  O
Korean  O
barbeque  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Second  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
Kimchi  O
Moriawase  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
and  O
Namuru  O
Moriawase  O
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
was  O
complimentary  O
just  O
like  O
what  O
we  O
will  O
get  O
in  O
a  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
Kimchi  O
Moriawase  O
is  O
a  O
platter  O
of  O
assorted  O
kimchi  O
consisting  O
of  O
cucumber  O
,  O
chinese  O
cabbage  O
and  O
white  O
radish  O
kimchi  O
.  O

The  O
Namuru  O
Moriawase  O
is  O
another  O
platter  O
of  O
vegetables  O
making  O
up  O
of  O
lightly  O
seasoned  O
white  O
radish  O
,  O
bean  O
sprout  O
,  O
cinnamon  O
fern  O
and  O
spinach  O
.  O

The  O
cinnamon  O
fern  O
was  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
diners  O
.  O

Dashimaki  O
Tamago  O
4/5  O
For  O
a  O
different  O
,  O
the  O
Dashimaki  O
Tamago  O
(  O
$  O
6.80  O
)  O
at  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
sweet  O
compared  O
to  O
other  O
Japan  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
prefer  O
the  O
version  O
served  O
at  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
because  O
it  O
has  O
a  O
more  O
natural  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Wagyu  O
Tongue  O
4/5  O
If  O
you  O
are  O
adventurous  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
Wagyu  O
Tongue  O
(  O
80gram  O
for  O
$  O
29  O
,  O
120gram  O
for  O
$  O
39  O
)  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
the  O
diners  O
in  O
the  O
group  O
were  O
game  O
to  O
it  O
so  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
have  O
more  O
.  O

Lightly  O
seasoned  O
with  O
just  O
pepper  O
and  O
salt  O
,  O
the  O
wagyu  O
tongue  O
needs  O
only  O
30  O
seconds  O
on  O
the  O
grill  O
to  O
be  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O
wagyu  O
tongue  O
actually  O
taste  O
quite  O
nice  O
with  O
its  O
nice  O
marbling  O
.  O

The  O
texture  O
was  O
rather  O
bouncy  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
scallop  O
.  O

Premium  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
starat  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
their  O
premium  O
wagyu  O
beef  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
following  O
Wagyu  O
cuts  O
,  O
Toku-Jo-Bara  O
(  O
Premium  O

.  O

Ito  O
Kacho  O
imports  O
these  O
beautiful  O
marbled  O
meat  O
solely  O
from  O
Kyushu  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
first  O
Yakiniku  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Japan  O
to  O
use  O
chilled  O
meat  O
instead  O
of  O
frozen  O
meat  O
to  O
retain  O
the  O
marbling  O
and  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
better  O
overall  O
consistency  O
.  O

After  O
trying  O
the  O

,  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
obvious  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O

is  O
subpar  O
to  O
the  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O

is  O
the  O
Tsubo-Zuke-Kurobuta  O
(  O
pork  O
collar  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O

The  O
chef  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
the  O
pork  O
collar  O
was  O
marinated  O
overnight  O
everyday  O
,  O
no  O
wonder  O
it  O
was  O
so  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O

these  O
prawns  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

The  O
squids  O
and  O
Hokkaido  O
scallops  O
were  O
cooked  O
in  O
aluminum  O
tray  O
over  O
the  O
grill  O
together  O
with  O
some  O
marinade  O
.  O

The  O
squid  O
and  O
scallops  O
were  O
fresh  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
seasoning  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
mild  O
side  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
expecting  O
something  O
stronger  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

King  O

Yaki  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
King  O
Crab  O
Yaki  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
)  O
was  O
huge  O
and  O
meaty  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
so  O
beautiful  O
that  O
we  O
ate  O
it  O
cold  O
without  O
grilling  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
that  O
like  O
fried  O
stuff  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
tried  O
the  O
King  O
Crab  O
Tempura  O
(  O

)  O
.  O

Lightly  O
battered  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O

its  O
another  O
way  O
of  O
enjoying  O
this  O
lovely  O

.  O

Spider  O
Roll  O
4/5  O
I  O
was  O
wondering  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
Spider  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
when  O
Melissa  O
ordered  O
it  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
actually  O
Soft  O
Shell  O
Crab  O
Sushi  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
term  O
spider  O
probably  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
legs  O
of  O
the  O
soft  O
shell  O
crab  O
sticking  O
outfrom  O
the  O
roll  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
not  O
into  O

,  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
also  O
offers  O
a  O
slate  O
of  O
other  O
tradition  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
Ishiyaki  O
Sundubu  O
Chige  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
either  O
beef  O
or  O
clam  O
soup  O

.  O

In  O
the  O
piping  O
hot  O
spicy  O
soup  O
served  O
in  O
sizzling  O
stone  O
bowl  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
find  O
tofu  O
,  O
clams  O
,  O
and  O
mushrooms  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
soup  O
just  O
nice  O
for  O
the  O
cold  O
weather  O
.  O

Ishiyaki  O

The  O
Ishiyaki  O
Bibimbap  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
can  O
serve  O
2  O
pax  O
too  O
.  O

Not  O
too  O
sure  O
what  O
the  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
of  O
but  O
it  O
beautifully  O
brought  O
the  O
dish  O
together  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
crispy  O
burnt  O
bits  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
of  O
the  O
sizzling  O
hot  O
stone  O
bowl  O
,  O
giving  O
the  O
dish  O
an  O
extra  O
texture  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
I  O
am  O
confused  O
by  O
the  O
food  O
served  O
at  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
meats  O
and  O
seafood  O
for  O
grill  O
,  O
the  O
menu  O
includes  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
.  O

So  O
is  O
this  O
a  O
Japanese  O
or  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
?  O

For  O
some  O
,  O
this  O
may  O
be  O
great  O
as  O
one  O
can  O
have  O
choices  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
Ito  O
Kacho  O
does  O
offer  O
top  O
grade  O
meats  O
for  O
the  O
barbeque  O
at  O
a  O
reasonable  O
rate  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
definitely  O
a  O
place  O
to  O
consider  O
if  O
one  O
is  O
craving  O
for  O
barbeque  O
.  O

Rotisserie  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O
The  O
last  O
time  O
I  O
visit  O
Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
was  O
probably  O
more  O
than  O
ten  O
years  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Suntec  O
City  O
branch  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
remember  O
back  O
then  O
itwas  O
self  O
service  O
,  O
one  O
needed  O
to  O
order  O
and  O
pay  O
at  O
the  O
counter  O
before  O
proceeding  O
down  O
the  O
line  O
to  O
collect  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

Service  O
has  O
since  O
changed  O
.  O

Your  O
order  O
is  O
now  O
taken  O
by  O
the  O
waiter/waitress  O
and  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
being  O
served  O
to  O
you  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Lucille  O
(  O
$  O
41.90  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
half  O
rotisserie  O
chicken  O
,  O
half  O
slab  O
of  O
honey  O
bourbon  O
ribs  O
and  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
3  O
regular  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
Rotisserie  O
Chicken  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
better  O
some  O
restaurants  O
I  O
have  O
tried  O
.  O

The  O
rotisserie  O
chicken  O
was  O
roasted  O
to  O
perfection  O
,  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
juicy  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

Honey  O
Bourbon  O
Ribs  O
4/5  O
The  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
Honey  O
Bourbon  O
Ribs  O
was  O
simply  O
finger  O
licking  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
tender  O
meat  O
with  O
the  O
beautiful  O
sauce  O
worked  O
in  O
harmony  O
for  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
better  O
ribs  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
.  O

Potato  O
Salad  O
3.5/5  O
Macaroni  O

Cheese  O
4/5  O

Coleslaw  O
3/5  O
Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
has  O
14  O
different  O
sides  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
categorized  O
under  O
hot  O
and  O
cold  O
sides  O
.  O

For  O
our  O
choices  O
of  O
3  O
sides  O
,  O
we  O
opted  O
for  O
the  O
Potato  O
Salad  O
,  O
Macaroni  O
&  O
Cheese  O
and  O
Coleslaw  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
three  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
macaroni  O
&  O
cheese  O
.  O

Not  O
because  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
best  O
but  O
the  O
potato  O
saladwas  O
over  O
dressed  O
with  O
mayonnaise  O
while  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
enjoy  O
the  O
onions  O
in  O
the  O
coleslaw  O
.  O

Corn  O
Muffin  O
4/5  O
Besides  O
the  O
signature  O
rotisserie  O
chicken  O
at  O
Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
,  O
the  O
other  O
memory  O
I  O
have  O
is  O
the  O
Corn  O
Muffin  O
.  O

Upon  O
taking  O
our  O
orders  O
,  O
complimentary  O
corn  O
muffin  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
did  O
n't  O
disappoint  O
me  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
before  O
.  O

Kenny  O
Rogers  O
Roasters  O
has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
20  O
years  O
and  O
it  O
just  O
showed  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
still  O
dishing  O
out  O
delectable  O
food  O
to  O
their  O
customers  O

Another  O
ramen  O
brand  O
in  O
Japan  O
has  O
ventured  O
offshore  O
with  O
its  O
first  O
oversea  O
establishment  O
at  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Originated  O
from  O
Hiroshima  O
Japan  O
with  O
over  O
40  O
stalls  O
,  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
Ramen  O
is  O
proud  O
of  O
their  O
super  O
rich  O
tonkotsu  O
broth  O
,  O
Saikyo  O
Nokou  O
(  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
characteristic  O
of  O
their  O
noodles  O
.  O

Not  O
to  O
be  O
mistaken  O
with  O
Uma  O
Uma  O
Ramen  O
at  O

the  O

ShoyuUma  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
rich  O
greasy  O
ramen  O
broth  O
so  O
I  O
opt  O
for  O
the  O
Shoyu  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
13.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
may  O
look  O
simple  O
yet  O
each  O
sip  O
of  O
the  O
fragrant  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
was  O
truly  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
broth  O
,  O
the  O
other  O
highlight  O
at  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
is  O
their  O
wheat  O
flour  O
noodles  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
is  O
thicker  O
with  O
a  O
firmer  O
and  O
springier  O
texture  O
.  O

Miso  O
Uma  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Miso  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
only  O
diced  O
flamed  O
charshu  O
and  O
corns  O
seem  O
rather  O
expensive  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
ramen  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
thick  O
cut  O
flamed  O
charshu  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
miso  O
broth  O
but  O
it  O
justgave  O
the  O
feeling  O
ofbeing  O
short  O
changed  O
with  O
the  O
pricing  O
.  O

Kara  O
Uma  O
3.5/5  O
This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
most  O
spicy  O
Kara  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
tried  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
spicier  O
than  O
what  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
Japan  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
and  O
love  O
for  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Aji  O
Tama  O
Uma  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
hot  O
seller  O
at  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
is  O
the  O
Aji  O
Tama  O
Uma  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
really  O
very  O
rich  O
and  O
robust  O
but  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
give  O
the  O
feeling  O
of  O
being  O
too  O
complex  O
in  O
flavours  O
.  O

For  O
just  O
a  O
mere  O
$  O
15  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
with  O
its  O
rich  O
flavours  O
,  O
thick  O
cut  O
flamed  O
pork  O
belly  O
and  O
ajitama  O
.  O

My  O
only  O
concern  O
is  O
the  O
layer  O
of  O
artery  O
clogging  O
oilfloating  O
onthe  O
surface  O
of  O
the  O

when  O

Gyoza  O
3/5  O
Besides  O
the  O
ramen  O
,  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
also  O
offers  O
a  O
few  O
side  O
dishes  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
Gyoza  O
(  O
5pc  O
for  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

The  O
thin  O
gyoza  O
skin  O
was  O
pan  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
but  O
the  O
filling  O
was  O
rather  O
unnoticeable  O
and  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O

star  O
of  O

Thethick  O
slices  O

grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
that  O
simply  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O

the  O

but  O
its  O
ramen  O
has  O
already  O
received  O
many  O
good  O
reviews  O
and  O
I  O
concurred  O
that  O
after  O
trying  O
out  O
their  O
ramen  O
.  O

Just  O
like  O
their  O
sloganSaikyo  O
Nokou  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
broth  O
is  O
indeed  O
very  O
rich  O
,  O
mellow  O
and  O
smooth  O
.  O

The  O
excellent  O
bowl  O
of  O
richness  O
should  O
be  O
proud  O
of  O
themselves  O
standing  O
tall  O
among  O

scene  O

The  O
prawn  O

rather  O
expensive  O
.  O

It  O
ranges  O
from  O

I  O
ordered  O

ca  O
n't  O
remember  O
what  O

the  O

4.2/5  O
The  O

packed  O
with  O
rich  O
robust  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O

Street  O
50  O
at  O
Bay  O
Hotel  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
former  O
Rumah  O
Rasa  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
since  O
been  O
revamped  O
dropping  O
their  O
halal  O
Indonesian  O
cuisine  O
concept  O
and  O
introducing  O
global  O
flavours  O
to  O
cater  O
for  O
a  O
wider  O
audience  O
.  O

Losing  O
focus  O
for  O
a  O
restaurant  O
?  O

Well  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
hotel  O
restaurant  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
understand  O
the  O
need  O
to  O
offer  O
diverse  O
flavours  O
to  O
both  O
visitors  O
and  O
Singaporeans  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Duck  O
and  O
Citrus  O
Fruits  O
3/5  O
The  O
Smoked  O
Duck  O
and  O
Citrus  O
Fruits  O
(  O
$  O
11  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
starter  O
to  O
whet  O
up  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
is  O
cooked  O
beautiful  O
,  O
tossed  O
in  O
orange  O
vincotto  O
dressing  O
with  O
orange  O
,  O
grapefruit  O
,  O
roasted  O
walnut  O
and  O
endive  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
citrus  O
vincotto  O
dressing  O
would  O
be  O
perfect  O
.  O

Caprese  O
3/5  O
The  O
Caprese  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointing  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
selection  O
of  O
interspersed  O
vineyard  O
tomatoes  O
were  O
beautifully  O
sweet  O
,  O
the  O
buffalo  O
mozzarella  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
dry  O
and  O
firm  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
those  O
that  O
is  O
served  O
moist  O
and  O
creamy  O
.  O

Hazelnut  O
Escargot  O
3/5  O
The  O
Burgundy  O
snails  O
were  O
stuffed  O
with  O
hazelnut  O
butter  O
and  O
then  O
slow  O
baked  O
.  O

The  O

Escargot  O

upon  O

Hotpot  O
Set4/5  O
Ok  O
this  O
is  O
something  O
really  O
interesting  O
.  O

When  O
was  O
the  O
last  O
time  O
youseen  O
a  O
hotel  O
restaurant  O
serving  O
steamboat  O
or  O
hotpot  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
?  O

I  O
doubt  O
there  O
was  O
any  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
3  O
Hotpot  O
Sets  O
(  O

32  O
for  O

$  O
48  O
for  O

and  O

offered  O
at  O
Street  O

with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
either  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
or  O
Chicken  O
soup  O
base  O
.  O

Each  O
side  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
vegetable  O
,  O
Yong  O

,  O

and  O
meat  O

Salmon  O
Cutlet  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Salmon  O
Cutlet  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
was  O
nicely  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
skin  O
while  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
still  O
pinkish  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

The  O
menu  O
said  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
aligot  O
potatoes  O
.  O

Aligot  O
supposes  O
to  O
be  O
fondue  O
form  O
to  O
my  O
humble  O
understanding  O
but  O
what  O
is  O
served  O
was  O
rather  O
mashymash  O
potatoes  O
.  O

Roulade  O
of  O
Porkloin  O
Stuffed  O
with  O
Wild  O
Rice  O
4/5  O
My  O
first  O
encounter  O
of  O
wild  O
rice  O
was  O
at  O
2fifteen  O
kitchen  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture.The  O
Roulade  O
of  O
Porkloin  O
Stuffed  O
with  O
Wild  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
)  O
was  O
done  O
pretty  O
well  O
with  O
aslab  O
of  O
porkloin  O
is  O
made  O
into  O
a  O
roll  O
with  O
wild  O
rice  O
resting  O
on  O
a  O

of  O

accompanied  O
by  O
a  O

of  O
brandied  O
prune  O
sauce  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

Duck  O
Pot  O
Pie  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
Duck  O
Pot  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
welcome  O
twist  O
to  O
the  O
usually  O
beef  O
that  O
is  O
used  O
for  O
the  O
puff  O
pastry  O
.  O

A  O
rich  O
wine  O

filled  O
with  O

the  O
baked  O

Orient  O
Barbecue  O
3.8/5  O
Another  O
fusion  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
the  O
Orient  O
Barbecue  O
Pizza  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
thin  O
crust  O
pizza  O
came  O
with  O
smoked  O
duck  O
,  O
enoki  O
mushroom  O
,  O
spring  O
onions  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
toppings  O
with  O
hoison  O
sauce  O
.  O

A  O
good  O
twist  O
to  O
the  O
norm  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
pizza  O
to  O
be  O
cheesy  O
rather  O
than  O
the  O
sweet  O
hoison  O
sauce  O
.  O

Lamb  O
Redang  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
star  O
and  O
highlight  O
at  O
Street  O
50  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
Lamb  O
Redang  O
(  O
$  O
24  O
)  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
signature  O
and  O
memorable  O
dish  O
of  O
the  O
old  O
Rumah  O
Rasa  O
and  O
the  O
new  O
Street  O
50  O
coming  O
together  O
in  O
a  O
plate  O
.  O

The  O
slow  O
braised  O
whole  O
lamb  O
shank  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
tender  O
soft  O
served  O
with  O
rendang  O
paste  O
,  O
carrots  O
,  O
potatoes  O
,  O
peas  O
and  O
jasmine  O
rice  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
definitely  O
a  O
dish  O
I  O
would  O
go  O
back  O
for  O
.  O

Apple  O
Strudel  O

The  O

baked  O
warm  O
Apple  O
Strudel  O
(  O

)  O
with  O
coconut  O

the  O

on  O
a  O

and  O
hearty  O
note  O

which  O
came  O

Although  O
the  O

selection  O
is  O
not  O
as  O
extensive  O
compared  O
to  O
others  O
,  O
it  O
definitely  O
made  O
up  O
for  O

with  O
its  O

.  O

My  O

began  O
with  O
some  O

The  O
oyster  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
fleshy.It  O
was  O
briny  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

Given  O
a  O
choice  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
oyster  O
to  O
be  O
creamy  O
and  O
fatter  O
.  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O

I  O

The  O
highlight  O
for  O
the  O

was  O
surprisingly  O
the  O
Cauliflower  O

with  O
luxurious  O
chucks  O
of  O

Each  O

was  O
bursting  O
with  O
robust  O
flavours  O
that  O
was  O
both  O

I  O
do  O
n't  O
think  O
the  O
flavour  O

anything  O
near  O
to  O
it  O

it  O
was  O

,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Yu  O
Sheng  O
to  O
usher  O
in  O
the  O
Year  O
of  O
the  O
Snake  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
makansutra  O
regulars  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
tradition  O
every  O
year  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Garlic  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Steamed  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Garlic  O
was  O
nothing  O
special  O
but  O
showcased  O
the  O
freshness  O
and  O
how  O
the  O
used  O
simple  O
ingredients  O
can  O
lift  O
a  O
dish  O
to  O
a  O
new  O
dimension  O
.  O

Double  O
Prosperity  O
Baby  O
Kailan  O
3/5  O
The  O
Baby  O
Kailan  O
done  O
2  O
ways  O
was  O
interesting  O
especially  O
but  O
not  O
fantastic  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
Kailan  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crunch  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
bland  O
and  O
bitter  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
stir  O
fried  O
baby  O
kailan  O
.  O

Yummy  O
Imperial  O
Chicken  O
3/5  O
The  O
Yummy  O
Imperial  O
Chicken  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
garlic  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
for  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

Braised  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
with  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
3.8/5  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
Braised  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
with  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
.  O

At  O
least  O
for  O
me  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
such  O
combination  O
being  O
served  O
in  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
sea  O
cucumber  O
and  O
pork  O
knuckle  O
were  O
cooked  O
until  O
fork  O
tender  O
that  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

Special  O
Butter  O
Bun  O
3/5  O
The  O
Special  O
Butter  O
Bun  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
same  O
as  O
steamed  O
custard  O
bun  O
.  O

The  O
lava  O
filling  O
was  O
delish  O
but  O
the  O
skin  O
of  O
the  O
bun  O
was  O
rather  O
dry  O
and  O
a  O
tad  O
thick  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
had  O
the  O
following  O
dishes  O
Chicken  O
in  O
Pig  O
Stomach  O
Soup  O
,  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
with  O
Wat  O
Meat  O
and  O
Homemade  O
Dou  O
Hua  O
which  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
take  O
any  O
photos  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
is  O
still  O
short  O
of  O
being  O
a  O
full  O
fledged  O
restaurant  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
nice  O
but  O
needs  O
to  O
raise  O
their  O
standard  O
from  O
the  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O

One  O
will  O
not  O
miss  O
the  O

and  O
white  O
theme  O

of  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
located  O
along  O
Bukit  O

.  O

The  O
Greek  O
Restaurant  O
opened  O
by  O
couple  O
Effie  O
and  O
Dennis  O
Tsakiris  O
created  O
a  O
warmmediterranean  O
sea  O
settingin  O
a  O
fourth  O
storey  O
building  O
,  O
born  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
founder  O
's  O
love  O
of  O
sharing  O
a  O
hearty  O
with  O
friends  O
.  O

Serving  O
Greek  O
cuisine  O
,  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
cooked  O
using  O
their  O
own  O
family  O
brand  O
of  O
extra  O
virgin  O
olive  O
oil  O
called  O
Green  O
Gold  O
which  O
can  O
also  O
be  O
purchased  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
understand  O
that  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
serves  O
authentic  O
Greek  O
food  O
that  O
has  O
not  O
been  O
adjusted  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
palates  O
.  O

Pita  O
Bread  O
and  O
Dips  O
4/5  O
The  O
lunch  O
started  O
off  O
withPita  O
Bread  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
with  O
sea  O
salt  O
and  O
paprika  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
pita  O
bred  O
is  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
fluffy  O
inside  O
.  O

Pair  O
with  O
delectable  O
dips  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
starter  O
tantalising  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
dips  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Fava  O
(  O
$  O
11.80  O
)  O
,  O
Taramosalata  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
and  O
Melitzanosalata  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
Fava  O
is  O
yellow  O
lentils  O
with  O
fresh  O
onion  O
,  O
oregano  O
and  O
extra  O
virgin  O
olive  O
oil  O
.  O

Taramosalata  O
iscod  O
roe  O
dip  O
and  O
Melitzanosalata  O
is  O
smoked  O
eggplant  O
mixed  O
with  O
herbs  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
make  O
up  O
my  O
mind  O
which  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
as  O
all  O
of  O
them  O
were  O
as  O
good  O
having  O
their  O
own  O
distinct  O
flavour  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Feta  O
3/5  O
This  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
the  O
whole  O
slice  O
of  O
Grilled  O
Feta  O
Cheese  O
(  O
$  O
12.80  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
an  O
expert  O
in  O
cheese  O
appreciation  O
but  O
the  O
feta  O
cheese  O
is  O
usually  O
a  O
bit  O
moist  O
,  O
salty  O
and  O
milky  O
.  O

After  O
being  O
grilled  O
,  O
it  O
lost  O
its  O
saltiness  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
milky  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
firmer  O
and  O
more  O
enjoyable  O
texture  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Spanakopita  O
4.2/5  O
Love  O
the  O
Spanakopita  O
(  O
$  O
12.30  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
phylo  O
pastry  O
filled  O
with  O
spinach  O
,  O
feta  O
cheese  O
and  O
herbs  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
spinach  O
and  O
cheesy  O
stuff  O
hence  O
the  O
filling  O
was  O
a  O
winning  O
combination  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
paper  O
thin  O
pastry  O
was  O
also  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
that  O
was  O
both  O
crispy  O
and  O
flaky  O
.  O

Kreatika  O

I  O
also  O

which  O
comes  O
with  O
meat  O
balls  O
,  O
kalamaki  O
,  O
bifteki  O
(  O
beef  O
patty  O
)  O
and  O
lamb  O
chops  O
.  O

Except  O
for  O
the  O
lamb  O
chops  O
which  O
was  O
really  O
flavoursome  O
and  O
succulent  O
,  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
platter  O
was  O
rather  O
toughor  O
dry  O
.  O

Psari  O

,  O

was  O
excellent  O
.  O

Nicely  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
smokey  O
flavour  O
,  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Mousaka  O
4.2/5  O
Our  O
group  O
was  O
already  O
done  O
with  O
our  O
lunch  O
but  O
we  O
ca  O
n't  O
help  O
ordering  O
the  O
Mousaka  O
(  O
$  O
24.80  O
)  O
because  O
it  O
smelled  O
so  O
good  O
from  O
the  O
table  O
beside  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
traditional  O
Greek  O
dish  O
of  O
oven  O
baked  O
eggplant  O
with  O
potatoes  O
,  O
minced  O
meat  O
and  O
bechamel  O
sauce  O
was  O
really  O
hearty  O
and  O
comforting  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
decor  O
of  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
.  O

The  O
relax  O
and  O
casual  O
ambience  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
made  O
one  O
felt  O
like  O
being  O
transported  O
to  O
Greek  O
or  O
the  O
Mediterranean  O
Sea  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
who  O
drives  O
,  O
not  O
to  O
worry  O
as  O
the  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
complimentary  O
valet  O
service  O

My  O
job  O
requires  O
me  O
to  O
travel  O
quite  O
often  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
craved  O
for  O
our  O
local  O
food  O
whenever  O
I  O
am  O
back  O
home  O
.  O

So  O
I  O
would  O
usually  O
head  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
nearest  O
food  O
centre  O
or  O
coffeeshop  O
to  O
satisfy  O
my  O
craving  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
local  O
food  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
or  O
Char  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
simpleplate  O
of  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
version  O
.  O

In  O
short  O
there  O
is  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
which  O
is  O
lighter  O
in  O
taste  O
while  O
the  O
local  O
version  O
is  O
sweeter  O
using  O
the  O
sweet  O
dark  O
sauce  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
local  O
style  O
comes  O
in  O
wet  O
or  O
dry  O
version  O
.  O

My  O
preference  O
is  O
the  O
wet  O
version  O
.  O

Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
4.5/5  O
Besides  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
stall  O
which  O
is  O
conveniently  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
coffeshop  O
just  O
next  O
block  O
where  O
I  O
am  O
staying  O
,  O
my  O
current  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
at  O
Zion  O
Riverside  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Each  O
batch  O
is  O
freshly  O
cooked  O
upon  O
order  O
hence  O
be  O
patient  O
with  O
the  O
long  O
queue  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
here  O
because  O
the  O
wetness  O
of  O
the  O
noodles  O
were  O
just  O
right  O
not  O
overly  O
done  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
it  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
cockles  O
,  O
slices  O
of  O
fish  O
cake  O
,  O
lup  O

the  O

Noodle  O
(  O

The  O

came  O

minched  O
chicken  O

was  O
rather  O

Are  O
you  O
a  O
pancake  O
lover  O
?  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
,  O
you  O
will  O
be  O
glad  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
pancake  O
specialty  O
full  O

at  O
City  O
Square  O
Mall  O
offering  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
pancakes  O
fromaround  O
the  O
world  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
pancakes  O
such  O
as  O
Pannekoeks  O
,  O
Galettes  O
,  O
American  O
Stacks  O
,  O

Paddington  O
House  O

serves  O
both  O
savoury  O
and  O
sweet  O
pancakes  O
.  O

One  O
can  O
indulge  O
in  O
a  O
hearty  O
meal  O
or  O
a  O
sweet  O
sinful  O
dessert  O
any  O
time  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

Lucerne  O
4/5  O
Galette  O
is  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
pancake  O
well  O
known  O
in  O
Brittany  O
,  O
North  O
West  O
of  O
France  O
made  O
from  O
organic  O
buckwheat  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Lucerne  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
served  O
like  O
a  O
pizza  O
with  O
mixed  O
seafood  O
,  O
creamy  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
on  O
top  O
a  O
thin  O
largegalette  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
pancake  O
is  O
rather  O
thin  O
,  O
this  O
need  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
quickly  O
if  O
not  O
the  O
pancake  O
will  O
become  O
soggy  O
.  O

Since  O
this  O
is  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
like  O
a  O
pizza  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
shell  O
of  O
the  O
mussel  O
and  O
tail  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
prawns  O
to  O
be  O
removed  O
.  O

Alaska  O
4/5  O
If  O
you  O
are  O
looking  O
for  O
a  O
full  O
meal  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
their  O
savoury  O
pancake  O
meals  O
served  O
with  O
double  O
'XL  O
'  O
Flapjacks  O
.  O

Flapjack  O
is  O
a  O
kind  O
of  O
thick  O
small  O
pancake  O
usually  O
around  O
10cm  O
in  O
diameter  O
.  O

The  O
Alaska  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
spicy  O
mashed  O
potato  O
pancakes  O
with  O
deep  O
fried  O
bread  O
crumbled  O
dory  O
and  O
creamy  O
mushroom  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
spicy  O
mashed  O
potato  O
pancakes  O
was  O
quite  O
interesting  O
because  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
our  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
the  O
locals  O
will  O
like  O
this  O
.  O

Paddington  O
House  O
of  O
Pancakes  O
does  O
not  O
focus  O
on  O
their  O
pancakes  O
only  O
.  O

Their  O
savoury  O
is  O
not  O
lacklustre  O
.  O

The  O
bread  O
crumbled  O
dory  O
was  O
deep  O
fried  O
toa  O
beautiful  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

Crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

Oslo  O
3.8/5  O
Another  O
flapjack  O
savoury  O
meal  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
Oslo  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
.  O

Comes  O
with  O
pinkish  O
smoked  O
salmon  O
and  O
cheesy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
with  O
grilled  O
zucchini  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
another  O
delightfully  O
hearty  O
meal  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
runny  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Dijon  O
4.2/5  O
For  O
the  O
savoury  O
pancakes  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
goes  O
to  O
Dijon  O
(  O
$  O
21  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
crepes  O
with  O
grilled  O
lamb  O
shoulders  O
with  O
peach  O
,  O
plum  O
and  O
passionfruit  O
mustard  O
dressing  O
.  O

The  O
hint  O
of  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
from  O
the  O
dressing  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
lamb  O
shoulder  O
won  O
my  O
heart  O
.  O

In  O
my  O
opinion  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
tissue  O
thin  O
crepe  O
complements  O
the  O
savoury  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
fluffy  O
thick  O
pancake  O
.  O

I  O
agreed  O
the  O
lamb  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
but  O
overall  O
balance  O
in  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
Dijon  O
stood  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

All  O
Paddington  O
House  O
of  O
Pancakes  O
'  O
sundaes  O
are  O
uniquely  O
served  O
with  O
dollar  O
pancakes  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
to  O
call  O
them  O
mini  O
pancakes  O
.  O

Its  O
kind  O
of  O
like  O
having  O
waffles  O

all  O
mixed  O
up  O

.  O

Chocolate  O
Roll  O
4.2/5  O
For  O
the  O
Sweet  O
Pannekoek  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Chocolate  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
with  O
peanut  O
butter  O
,  O
ice  O
cream  O
,  O
Oreo  O
crumbs  O
,  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
,  O
nuts  O
and  O
whipped  O
cream  O
.  O

Pannekoek  O
is  O
a  O
Dutch/Belgian  O
pancake  O
that  O
is  O
usually  O
larger  O
and  O
much  O
thinner  O
than  O
American  O
or  O
Scottish  O
pancakes  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
roll  O
pannekoek  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
local  O
snack  O
,  O
Min  O

Bombon  O
Dollars  O
4/5  O
For  O
the  O
Dollar  O
Pancakes  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Bombon  O
Dollars  O
(  O

Served  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O

,  O
nuts  O
and  O
ice  O
creamwith  O
condensed  O
milk  O
at  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

It  O
feltlike  O
a  O
breakfast  O
bowl  O
.  O

We  O
thought  O
the  O
Bombon  O
Dollars  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
dry  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
until  O
we  O
realized  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
pour  O
the  O
condensed  O
milk  O
into  O
the  O
bowl  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Chips  O
Pancake  O

also  O
tried  O
the  O
Chocolate  O
Chips  O
Pancake  O
(  O

)  O
that  O
is  O

with  O
a  O
scoop  O
of  O
ice  O
cream  O
,  O
marshmallows  O
,  O
nuts  O
and  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
American  O
pancake  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
golden  O
ring  O
around  O
the  O
edge  O
with  O
a  O
crisp  O
while  O
the  O
middle  O
was  O
fluffy  O
.  O

The  O
Pancakes  O
at  O
Paddington  O
are  O
prepared  O
freshly  O
daily  O
at  O
the  O
outlet  O
.  O

A  O
little  O
patient  O
is  O
needed  O
as  O
the  O
pancakes  O
are  O
flipped  O
upon  O
order  O
and  O
served  O
right  O
from  O
the  O
pan  O
to  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

Paddington  O

has  O
an  O
extensive  O
varieties  O

which  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Botanic  O
Garden  O
but  O
the  O
thought  O
of  O
the  O
inaccessibility  O
always  O
put  O
me  O
off  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
heard  O
that  O
Halia  O
has  O
opened  O
a  O
new  O
restaurant  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Hotel  O
Singapore  O
,  O
I  O
jumped  O
on  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
establishment  O
.  O

A  O
highlight  O
of  O
The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Hotel  O
is  O
its  O
al  O
fresco  O
bar  O
that  O
serve  O
handcrafted  O
artisanal  O
beverage  O
products  O
around  O
the  O
world  O
.  O

The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Place  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
defunct  O
Seah  O
Street  O
Deli  O
.  O

Position  O
as  O
an  O
urban  O
casual  O
restaurant  O
,  O
serving  O
contemporary  O
European  O
cuisine  O
with  O
Asian  O
touches  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
removed  O
the  O
usual  O
appetiser  O
and  O
mains  O
from  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Instead  O
it  O
introduces  O
an  O
unique  O
concept  O
of  O
small  O
plates  O
and  O
big  O
plates  O
to  O
encourage  O
communal  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
customising  O
your  O
own  O
degustation  O
in  O
a  O
fun  O
and  O
flexible  O
manner  O
.  O

Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O
From  O
the  O
small  O
plates  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
,  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
,  O
Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
,  O
Confit  O
Salmon  O
and  O
Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
us  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
our  O
greens  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
bitterness  O
.  O

The  O
apricot  O
chutney  O
and  O
blueberry  O
of  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
23  O
)  O
masked  O
off  O
that  O
unpleasant  O
taste  O
,  O
giving  O
the  O
greens  O
a  O
nice  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
sweetness  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
overwhelming  O
towards  O
the  O
end  O
when  O
the  O
greens  O
got  O
lesser  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
4.2/5  O
Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
salad  O
small  O
plate  O
,  O
The  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
was  O
more  O
balanced  O
in  O
execution  O
and  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
radish  O
,  O
chilli  O
,  O
hazelnut  O
and  O
ginger  O
flower  O
dressing  O
worked  O
in  O
harmony  O
while  O
the  O
chicken  O
breast  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
4.2/5  O
This  O
is  O
one  O
dish  O
at  O
Halia  O
that  O
everyone  O
is  O
raving  O
about  O
.  O

The  O
Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
but  O
adoresby  O
carnivores  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
innovative  O
dish  O
substituted  O
the  O
lasagna  O
noodles  O
with  O
slices  O
of  O
celeriac  O
.  O

Instead  O
of  O
meaty  O
mixture  O
,  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
mixture  O
of  O
mushroom  O
,  O
thyme  O
,  O
baby  O
spinach  O
,  O
lemon  O
and  O
madeira  O
cream  O
is  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
earthy  O
flavours  O
and  O
the  O
crunchy  O
celeriac  O
opened  O
my  O
eyes  O
to  O
the  O
world  O
of  O
culinary  O
and  O
changed  O
my  O
mindset  O
about  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
.  O

Confit  O
Salmon  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
exquisite  O
Salmon  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
surrounded  O
by  O
a  O
beautiful  O
garden  O
of  O
roast  O
floret  O
,  O
tomato  O
and  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
with  O
vanilla  O
.  O

The  O
pinkish  O
salmon  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

Thetexture  O
of  O
the  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
was  O
smooth  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
enjoy  O
the  O
vanilla  O
flavour  O
with  O
the  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
to  O
just  O
leave  O
out  O
the  O
vanilla  O
.  O

Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O
dish  O
,  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing.The  O
oriental  O
pulled  O
duck  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
while  O
the  O
soba  O
provided  O
the  O
texture  O
contrast.It  O
was  O
something  O
different  O
for  O
a  O
contemporary  O
European  O
cuisine  O
restaurant  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Potato  O
Fries  O
4.2/5  O
and  O
Polenta  O
Coated  O
Asparagus  O
3/5  O
After  O
trying  O
out  O
the  O
the  O
small  O
plates  O
,  O
we  O
had  O
some  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
and  O
Polenta  O
Coated  O
Asparagus  O
(  O

from  O

while  O
waiting  O
for  O
our  O
big  O
plates  O
.  O

The  O
potato  O
friesis  O
paired  O
with  O
truffle  O
aioli  O
and  O
piquant  O
mayo  O

while  O
the  O

The  O
Javanese  O
Spice  O
Maori  O
Lakes  O
Rack  O
of  O
Lamb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

Served  O
with  O
eggplant  O
puree  O
and  O
red  O
pepper  O
relish  O
,  O
the  O
lamb  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
not  O
gamy  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
sweetness  O
on  O
the  O
lamb  O
,  O
probably  O
from  O
the  O
marination  O
of  O
the  O
javanese  O
spice  O
.  O

turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
most  O
well  O
received  O
dish  O
for  O
the  O
tonight  O
.  O

Pardon  O
the  O
appearance  O
that  O
looks  O
like  O
2  O
burnt  O
pieces  O
of  O
chicken  O

The  O

served  O
with  O

.  O

Probably  O

the  O

was  O
a  O

of  O
words  O
to  O
describe  O

taken  O
back  O
how  O

(  O

can  O
work  O
beautifully  O
for  O

It  O
is  O
also  O

harmonised  O
with  O
the  O

The  O
Sticky  O
Toffee  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O

may  O
look  O
rather  O
boring  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
really  O
quite  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
date  O
pudding  O
was  O

was  O
excellently  O
paired  O
with  O

Custard  O

a  O
first  O

The  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Terrine  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
get  O
me  O
excited  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
foie  O
gras  O
pan  O
seared.Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
pineapple  O
chutneygoes  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
enjoyed  O
spreading  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
over  O
the  O
bread  O
and  O
eating  O
it  O
that  O
way  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
black  O
oilve  O
crumber  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
redundant  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
hard  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O

came  O
with  O

It  O
gave  O
that  O
nice  O
extra  O

The  O

revealed  O
the  O

while  O
the  O
exterior  O
was  O

Accompanied  O

the  O

(  O

Taste  O
wise  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
has  O
potential  O
with  O
very  O
distinct  O
and  O
robust  O
flavours  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
believe  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
quality  O
control  O
on  O
the  O
salt  O
,  O
this  O
can  O
be  O
another  O
fusion  O

that  O
the  O
new  O
generation  O
will  O
enjoy  O

Nonya  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Nonya  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
for  O
1pax  O
,  O
$  O

for  O

)  O
with  O
potatoes  O
and  O
carrots  O
served  O
with  O
bread  O
.  O

Many  O
that  O
have  O
visited  O
the  O
bistro  O
gave  O
good  O
reviews  O
for  O
their  O
curry  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
even  O
told  O
that  O
the  O
Indians  O
at  O
Little  O
India  O
also  O
like  O
their  O
Nonya  O
style  O
curry  O
.  O

So  O
did  O
it  O
disappoint  O
me  O
?  O

No  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
prefer  O
Nonya  O
curry  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
curry  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
thick  O
gravy  O
and  O
spices  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
nonya  O
curry  O
chicken  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
large  O
pieces  O
of  O
tender  O
chicken  O
that  O
is  O
rather  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Singaporean  O
probably  O
will  O
know  O
how  O
crowded  O
Little  O
India  O
can  O
be  O
during  O
the  O
weekends  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
Steam  O
Sia  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
quieter  O
side  O
of  O
Little  O
India  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
where  O
I  O
can  O
enjoy  O
a  O
peaceful  O
meal  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
vicinity  O
does  O
not  O
offer  O
many  O
non  O
Indian  O
food  O
eateries  O
,  O
Steam  O
Sia  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
choice  O
for  O
a  O
different  O
.  O

With  O
more  O
budgets  O
hotels  O
being  O
builtin  O
thearea  O
,  O
it  O
may  O
also  O
offer  O
the  O

Some  O
even  O
labelled  O
it  O
as  O
the  O
best  O

in  O

Is  O
it  O
so  O

that  O
it  O

which  O
comes  O
with  O

the  O

.  O

The  O
buns  O
which  O
is  O
made  O
exclusively  O
by  O
a  O
local  O
bakery  O
is  O
light  O
and  O
springy  O
with  O
good  O

.  O

To  O
bring  O
the  O

to  O
Asia  O
,  O
even  O
the  O
cheese  O
is  O
imported  O
from  O

.  O

I  O
like  O
my  O
burger  O
messy  O
and  O
Omakase  O

did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
me  O
.  O

and  O

with  O

the  O

was  O
super  O

.  O

Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
3/5  O
This  O
is  O
not  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
.  O

Sofries  O
offers  O
it  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
served  O
as  O
french  O
fries  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
to  O
the  O
norm  O
.  O

A  O
little  O
disappointment  O
in  O
how  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

As  O
it  O
was  O
stacked  O
into  O
a  O
glass  O
,  O
the  O
water  O
vapour  O
has  O
caused  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
to  O
be  O
soaky  O
.  O

So  O
what  O
is  O
my  O
verdict  O
of  O
the  O
burger  O
?  O

Is  O
it  O
the  O
best  O
?  O

Yes  O
!  O

I  O
agreed  O
the  O
Omakase  O
Burger  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
in  O
town  O
.  O

However  O
will  O
the  O
burger  O
joint  O
be  O
successful  O
it  O
waits  O
to  O
be  O
seen  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
may  O
have  O
found  O
the  O
right  O
formuale  O
for  O
the  O
best  O
burger  O
but  O
the  O
size  O
and  O
price  O
will  O
be  O
hard  O
to  O
convince  O
consumers  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O

the  O

the  O

the  O

Medan  O
Town  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
growing  O
dining  O
enclave  O
of  O
Tanjong  O
Katong  O
.  O

The  O
casual  O
dining  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
home  O
style  O
Medanese  O
food  O
which  O
reflects  O
the  O
diverse  O
cooking  O
styles  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
races  O
living  O
in  O
Medan  O
.  O

Bihun  O

The  O
marquee  O
dish  O
at  O
Medan  O
Town  O
is  O
the  O
Bihun  O
Bebek  O
Dry/Soup  O
(  O
$  O
5.80  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
beehoon  O
dry  O
served  O
with  O
duck  O
herbal  O
soup  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Thebowl  O
of  O
beehoonwas  O
topped  O
with  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
shredded  O
duck  O
,  O
fried  O
garlic  O
,  O
spring  O
onion  O
and  O
bean  O
sprouts.I  O
understand  O
the  O
rice  O
noodle  O
is  O
made  O
in  O
Medan.It  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
unique  O
springy  O
texture  O
that  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
others  O
.  O

Nasi  O

4.2/5  O
The  O
other  O
dish  O
at  O
Medan  O
Town  O
that  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
is  O
the  O
Nasi  O
Redang  O
Sapi  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
redang  O
was  O
extremely  O
tender  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
flavour  O
that  O
woke  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

At  O
thatinstant  O
,  O
memories  O
of  O
Indonesia  O
trips  O
flashed  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
,  O
an  O
authentic  O
taste  O
that  O
has  O
long  O
been  O
forgotten  O
.  O

Klepon  O

The  O
Klepon  O
(  O
$  O

for  O

)  O
is  O
boiled  O
rice  O
cake  O
stuffed  O
with  O
palm  O
sugar  O
and  O
rolled  O

grated  O
coconut  O
.  O

Singaporean  O
will  O
probably  O

.  O

The  O
rice  O
cake  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
chewy  O
texture  O
but  O
I  O
am  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
with  O
the  O
fillings  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
the  O
palm  O
sugar  O
filling  O
to  O
be  O
of  O
flowing  O

Wrapping  O
up  O
the  O

we  O
ordered  O
the  O

(  O

Both  O
areshaved  O

and  O
palm  O
sugar  O
.  O

The  O
different  O
is  O
the  O
ingredients  O
used  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
Campur  O
Medan  O
over  O
the  O
Chendol  O
Medan  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
chendol  O
was  O
homemade  O
,  O
the  O
colour  O
was  O
unappetising  O
and  O
lacking  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

I  O
previously  O
visited  O
a  O
Medanese  O
cuisine  O
restaurant  O
and  O
was  O
not  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

Medan  O
Town  O
has  O
changed  O
my  O
opinion  O
with  O

and  O
I  O
amglad  O
to  O

another  O

With  O
the  O
success  O
story  O
of  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
surprise  O
to  O
see  O
another  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
opening  O
its  O
door  O
for  O
business  O
at  O
neighbourhood  O
area  O
.  O

Soi  O

is  O
established  O
about  O
six  O
months  O
ago  O
at  O

Relying  O
on  O
my  O
lunch  O
partner  O
,  O
Maureen  O
's  O
dining  O
experience  O
at  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
she  O
told  O
me  O
the  O
concept  O
at  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
even  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
plates  O
usedfor  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
because  O
I  O
was  O
always  O
turned  O
off  O
by  O
the  O
long  O
queues  O
.  O

Anyway  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
at  O

(  O

3.8/5  O
Came  O
with  O

and  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
the  O
Thick  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
balanced  O
of  O
sourness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Only  O
disappointmentthere  O
is  O
no  O
seafood  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
more  O
choices  O
in  O
my  O
tom  O

soup  O
not  O
just  O
only  O
prawn  O
or  O
chicken  O

For  O
just  O
a  O

the  O

quite  O
worthy  O

Nicely  O

bite  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Kang  O

(  O

came  O
with  O
a  O
very  O
homely  O
flavour  O

Using  O

for  O
the  O
Beef  O
Paneang  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
style  O
red  O
chilli  O
beef  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
cheeks  O
were  O
extremely  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
not  O
really  O
a  O
spicy  O
dish  O
more  O
towards  O
the  O
sweetness  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
goes  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
very  O
well  O
.  O

Chicken  O
4/5  O
The  O
Thai  O
Yellow  O
Ginger  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
,  O
nicely  O
coated  O
with  O
the  O
yellow  O
ginger  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
thought  O
the  O
dishcan  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
spicier  O
.  O

Sea  O

4.2/5  O
Something  O
for  O
a  O
different  O
this  O
time  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
with  O
Namjim  O
Larb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
was  O
the  O
Namjim  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Made  O
with  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
garlic  O
,  O
fish  O
sauce  O
,  O
lime  O
juices  O
,  O
sugar  O
and  O
chilli  O
,  O
the  O
sournesswent  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
fish  O
meat  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
minced  O
pork  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

(  O

)  O
wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
sumptuous  O
lunch  O
at  O
Soi  O

Kitchen  O
.  O

I  O
consider  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
with  O
the  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
pricing  O
.  O

At  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
send  O
back  O
your  O
food  O
for  O
adjustment  O
if  O
you  O
find  O
it  O
not  O
spicy  O
enough  O
or  O
too  O
spicy  O
to  O
your  O

Now  O
or  O
rather  O
for  O
the  O
moment  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
and  O
reason  O
to  O
skip  O

Miso  O
Soup  O
4/5  O
I  O
was  O
wondering  O
why  O
theMiso  O
Soupwas  O
served  O
in  O
the  O
midde  O
of  O
our  O
meal  O
instead  O
at  O
the  O

which  O
most  O
restaurants  O
do  O
.  O

Unlike  O
others  O
,  O
the  O
miso  O
soup  O
here  O
is  O
only  O
cook  O
a  O
la  O
minute  O
hence  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
salty  O
compared  O
to  O
those  O
thatwas  O
pre-cooked  O
and  O
kept  O
under  O
constant  O
heat  O
.  O

Mango  O
Roll  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Mango  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
beautifully  O
presented  O
but  O
not  O
practical  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
kept  O
sliding  O
down  O
from  O
the  O
sushi  O
roll  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
separated  O
as  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
eat  O
the  O
mango  O
separately  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
sweet  O
enough  O
,  O
lacking  O
the  O
refreshing  O
contrast  O
in  O
taste  O
.  O

explained  O
that  O
this  O
particular  O
soba  O
is  O
not  O
available  O
on  O

Have  O
you  O
heard  O
of  O
Bespoke  O
Cocktails  O
?  O

It  O
means  O
walking  O
into  O
a  O
bar  O
and  O
the  O
mixlogist  O
will  O
customise  O
your  O
drink  O
depending  O
on  O
your  O
mood  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
one  O
until  O
recently  O
when  O
I  O
met  O
Maureen  O
for  O
a  O
drink  O
at  O
Bar  O
Stories  O
before  O
our  O
tasting  O
session  O
in  O
the  O
evening  O
.  O

Located  O
among  O
the  O
rows  O
of  O
shophouses  O
at  O
hip  O
Haji  O
lane  O
,  O
the  O
quirky  O
bar  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
difficult  O
to  O
spot  O
.  O

Upon  O
settling  O
down  O
in  O
the  O
bar  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
wondering  O
what  O
to  O
do  O
as  O
there  O
was  O
no  O
menu  O
around  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
who  O
was  O
a  O
table  O
away  O
spotted  O
us  O
and  O
probably  O
he  O
couldtell  O
from  O
our  O
confused  O
face  O
,  O
came  O
over  O
and  O
asked  O
whether  O
it  O
is  O
our  O
first  O
time  O
at  O
Bar  O
Stories  O
.  O

After  O
giving  O
us  O
a  O
brief  O
introduction  O
of  O
the  O
place  O
andchecking  O
what  O
sort  O
oftaste/flavours  O
we  O
like  O
,  O
the  O
owner  O
asked  O
the  O
mixologist  O
tomix  O
a  O
cocktailfor  O
eachof  O
us  O
.  O

Maureen  O
who  O
is  O
crazy  O
with  O
Ispahan  O
requested  O
for  O
her  O
cocktail  O
to  O
come  O
with  O
lychee  O
and  O
rose  O
syrup  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
are  O
not  O
really  O
an  O
alcohol  O
person  O
,  O
the  O
cocktail  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
strong  O
inalcohol  O
content  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

We  O
preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
sweeter  O
.  O

Noticed  O
that  O
Maureen  O
did  O
not  O
finish  O
her  O
drink  O
,  O
the  O
owner  O
made  O
her  O
another  O
glass  O
of  O
cocktail  O
that  O
was  O
more  O
refreshing  O
and  O
sweeter  O
with  O
berries  O
and  O
grapes  O
flavours  O
partying  O
in  O
the  O
glass  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
preferred  O
sour  O
taste  O
,  O
the  O
mixologist  O
made  O
me  O
a  O
passionfruit  O
inspired  O
cocktail  O
.  O

The  O
cocktail  O
was  O
much  O
refreshing  O
and  O
easy  O
to  O
drink  O
compare  O
to  O
Maureen  O
's  O
Ispahan  O
inspired  O
cocktail  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
bespoke  O
cocktails  O
.  O

The  O
excitement  O
and  O
thrill  O
of  O
a  O
different  O
customised  O
cocktail  O
depending  O
on  O
one  O
's  O
mood  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
hidden  O
cocktail  O
bar  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
chill  O
out  O
place  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
with  O
each  O
cocktail  O
ranges  O
from  O
$  O
20  O
to  O
$  O

Won  O
Paik  O
,  O
Bornga  O
is  O
established  O
in  O
2002  O
in  O
Korea  O
.  O

Famed  O
for  O
numerous  O
patented  O
under  O
his  O
belt  O
,  O
Woo  O
Samgyupis  O
one  O
of  O
his  O
original  O
creations  O
offered  O
at  O
Bornga.Bornga  O
has  O
46  O
outlets  O
internationally  O
,  O
including  O
33  O
in  O
Korea  O
and  O
13  O
across  O
China  O
,  O
United  O
States  O
,  O
Indonesia  O
and  O
now  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Opened  O
at  O
Star  O
Vista  O
in  O
November  O
2012  O
,  O
Bornga  O
adds  O
to  O
the  O
growingKorean  O
BBQ-dinning  O
scene  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Ssamcheban  O
A  O
long  O
tray  O
of  O
fresh  O
raw  O
vegetables  O
is  O
served  O
at  O
Bornga  O
when  O
you  O
dine  O
you  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
adore  O
the  O
idea  O
instead  O
of  O
repeat  O
request  O
for  O
refilling  O
.  O

Interesting  O
fact  O
that  O
even  O
the  O
long  O
tray  O
is  O
patented  O
.  O

Like  O
all  O
Korean  O
restaurants  O
,  O

Samgyupsal  O
Samgyupsal  O
4.2/5  O
If  O
you  O
noticed  O
,  O
the  O
meat  O
at  O
Bornga  O
is  O
in  O
its  O
natural  O
colour  O
without  O
any  O
pre-marination  O
causing  O
the  O
colour  O
of  O
the  O
meat  O
to  O
be  O
dark  O
brown  O
or  O
black  O
.  O

Concerned  O
about  O
the  O
appearance  O
of  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
meats  O
,  O
Chef  O
Paik  O
created  O
a  O
new  O
Korean  O
style  O
of  O
BBQ  O
while  O
keeping  O
the  O
natural  O
colour  O
and  O
taste  O
of  O
meats  O
.  O

The  O
Samgyupsal  O
or  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
is  O
chosen  O
for  O
the  O
right  O
proportion  O
of  O
fat  O
and  O
meat  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
the  O
grilled  O
pork  O
belly  O
tasted  O
as  O
good  O
or  O
even  O
much  O
better  O
in  O
its  O
natural  O
flavour  O
without  O
marination  O
.  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O
Woo  O
Samgyup  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
star  O
attraction  O
and  O
probably  O
the  O
reason  O
for  O
repeated  O
customers  O
is  O
the  O
Woo  O
Samgyup  O
or  O
Thinly  O
Sliced  O
Beef  O
with  O
Bornga  O
's  O
Special  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
.  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O
is  O
served  O
shortly  O
after  O
being  O
doused  O
in  O
a  O
unique  O
dressing  O
that  O
retains  O
the  O
meat  O

natural  O
colour  O

enhancing  O
the  O
traditional  O

taste  O

Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O
For  O
starter  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
choice  O
between  O
the  O
Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
or  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
.  O

The  O
Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
with  O
its  O
fresh  O
greens  O
and  O
chunky  O
chicken  O
topped  O
with  O
delectable  O
dressing  O
tantalized  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
grapes  O
gave  O
the  O
salad  O
a  O
fruity  O
and  O
freshing  O
touch  O
.  O

French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
3/5  O
The  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
but  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
agreed  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
also  O
looking  O
for  O
more  O
caramalized  O
onions  O
in  O
the  O
soup  O
for  O
that  O
extra  O
textures  O
and  O
sweetness  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
all  O
there  O
,  O
it  O
just  O
need  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
fine  O
tuning  O
to  O
make  O
it  O
better  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Ballotine  O
4/5  O
Christmas  O
is  O
about  O
turkey  O
but  O
the  O
meat  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
tough  O
and  O
dry  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
done  O
properly  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
usually  O
avoid  O
turkey  O
whenever  O
it  O
is  O
possible  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
like  O
me  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
Chicken  O
Ballotine  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
39  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
nuts  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Just  O
picking  O
bones  O
here  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
brown  O
sauce  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
classic  O
.  O

It  O
will  O
be  O
good  O
if  O
we  O
can  O
have  O
a  O
saucethat  O
is  O
more  O
contrasting  O
and  O
adds  O
colour  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Guinness  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
&  O
Chips  O
4.2/5  O
When  O
I  O
visited  O
Backyard  O
@  O
Dempsey  O
in  O
August  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
Guinness  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
beer  O
for  O
battered  O
fish  O
but  O
the  O
dark  O
colour  O
appearance  O
is  O
not  O
very  O
presentable  O
so  O
they  O
have  O
the  O
Kronenbourg  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
instead  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
excited  O
when  O
I  O
knew  O
I  O
am  O
going  O
to  O
finally  O
taste  O
the  O
Guinness  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
battered  O
fish  O
came  O
with  O
hint  O
of  O
beer  O
flavour  O
,  O
nicely  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

Pork  O
Roulade  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Pork  O
Roulade  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
42  O
)  O
was  O
straight  O
forward  O
with  O
its  O
strong  O
and  O
intense  O
flavours  O
.  O

Meat  O
lover  O
will  O
adore  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Best  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
a  O
bottle  O
of  O
beer  O
.  O

Black  O
Angus  O
Ribeye  O
4.5/5  O
Among  O
the  O
4  O
mains  O
,  O
the  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Ribeye  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
52  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
evening  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
,  O
juicy  O
and  O
flavourful  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
smokiness  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
4/5  O
For  O
the  O
dessert  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
Tiramisu  O
or  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
.  O

The  O
Tiramisu  O
here  O
is  O
without  O
liqueur  O
and  O
on  O
the  O
cheesy  O
side  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
quite  O
like  O
this  O
version  O
as  O
I  O
love  O
my  O
cheese  O
.  O

Creme  O
Brulee  O
2.5/5  O
The  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
was  O
unfortunately  O
not  O
up  O
to  O
expectation  O
.  O

The  O
rich  O
custard  O
base  O
was  O
eggy  O
and  O
lacked  O
the  O
vanilla  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
layer  O
of  O
hard  O
caramel  O
sunk  O
in  O
instead  O
of  O
crackling  O
when  O
I  O
dug  O
my  O
spoon  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
to  O
eat  O
steamboat  O
because  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
joy  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
with  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
people  O
together  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
varieties  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
passed  O
by  O
Teochew  O
Traditional  O
Steamboat  O
Restaurant  O
at  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
on  O
several  O
occasions  O
and  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
always  O
crowded  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
until  O
recently  O
with  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
HungryGoWhere  O
foodies  O
.  O

Dipping  O
Sauces  O
Two  O
types  O
of  O
dipping  O
sauces  O
are  O
served  O
here  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
soy  O
sauce  O
,  O
chopped  O
red  O
chilli  O
,  O
spring  O
onions  O
and  O
fried  O
garlic  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
looking  O
for  O
a  O
more  O
fiery  O
kick  O
,  O
the  O
bright  O
orange  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
will  O
sure  O
break  O
one  O
into  O
a  O
sweat  O
.  O

The  O
steamboat  O
here  O
is  O
ala  O
carte  O
style  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
a  O
Teochew  O
himself  O
believes  O
the  O
importance  O
of  O
freshness  O
and  O
authenticity  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
determines  O
the  O
quality  O
of  O
the  O
dishes  O
.  O

Only  O
one  O
choice  O
of  O
soup  O
base  O
herethat  O
is  O
boiled  O
over  O
5  O
hours  O
using  O
chicken  O
bone  O
,  O
shark  O
bone  O
and  O
other  O
high  O
quality  O
secret  O
ingredients  O
resulting  O
in  O
a  O
natural  O
sweet  O
taste  O
.  O

Homemade  O
Fish  O
Balls  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
restaurant  O
freshly  O
hand  O
made  O
their  O
own  O
Fish  O
Balls  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
)  O
daily  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
balls  O
were  O
very  O
bouncy  O
and  O
springy  O
.  O

Fish  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
4.2/5  O
Made  O
with  O
fish  O
paste  O
,  O
the  O
Fish  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
(  O
$  O
5  O
)  O
was  O
firm  O
in  O
texture  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
delectable  O
bite  O
.  O

Spinach  O
Fish  O
Paste  O
Noodle  O
3.8/5  O
I  O
applauded  O
the  O
creativity  O
of  O
the  O
chendol  O
like  O
Spinach  O
Fish  O
Paste  O
Noodle  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
creation  O
by  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
small  O
in  O
size  O
to  O
enjoy  O
it  O
to  O
the  O
fullest  O
.  O

It  O
felt  O
like  O
the  O
taste  O
got  O
lostamong  O
the  O

I  O

An  O
important  O
ingredient  O
for  O
Mookata  O
is  O
Pork  O
Lard  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O

is  O
used  O
to  O
oil  O

of  O

By  O
doing  O
so  O
,  O
it  O
prevents  O
the  O

At  O
the  O

time  O

Made  O
of  O

caramelised  O

,  O
the  O
gula  O
melaka  O
is  O
the  O
star  O
as  O
the  O

quite  O

is  O
steamed  O

rolled  O
in  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
boring  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
it  O
alone  O
without  O
any  O

.  O

I  O

although  O
was  O
huge  O
the  O
proportion  O
of  O

was  O
quite  O
balanced  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
was  O
the  O
lacking  O
of  O
the  O
squirting  O

of  O

when  O
biting  O
into  O

If  O
you  O
have  O
been  O
to  O
Vietnam  O
,  O
you  O
would  O
probably  O
heard  O
of  O
Wrap  O

Roll  O
and  O
dine  O
there.I  O
used  O
to  O
travel  O
quite  O
a  O
bit  O
to  O
Ho  O
Chi  O
Minh  O
City  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
back  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Wrap  O

Roll  O
which  O
brings  O
to  O
the  O
table  O
authentic  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
at  O
a  O
relax  O
comtempoary  O
ambience  O
.  O

A  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
checking  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
Star  O
Vista  O
Mall  O
at  O
Buona  O
Vista  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
deciding  O
where  O
to  O
have  O
lunch  O
when  O
I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
someone  O
has  O
brought  O
the  O
restaurant  O
to  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Without  O
a  O
doubt  O
,  O
my  O
lunch  O
was  O
decided  O
.  O

Pho  O

and  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
in  O

4.2/5  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
is  O
all  O
about  O
fresh  O
vegetables  O
&  O
herbs  O
,  O
rice  O
paper  O
roll  O
and  O
fish  O
sauce  O
.  O

After  O
2  O
years  O
of  O
research  O
before  O
they  O
opened  O
their  O
first  O
restaurant  O
Feb  O
2006  O
in  O
Vietnam  O
,  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
not  O
only  O
brings  O
the  O
4  O
key  O
elements  O
of  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
to  O
the  O
table  O
but  O
also  O
the  O
different  O
styles  O
of  O
North  O
,  O
Central  O
and  O
South  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisines  O
.  O

Therollsare  O
the  O
star  O
of  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
Singapore  O
outlet  O
seems  O
to  O
have  O
lesser  O
varieties  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Vietnam  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Taste  O
of  O
Hanoi  O
(  O
North  O
Vietnam  O
)  O
rolls  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
.I  O
preferred  O
the  O
fresh  O
vegetables  O
and  O
herbs  O
of  O
the  O
Pho  O
Beef  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
to  O
the  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
latter  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
stuffing  O
and  O
pork  O
floss  O
on  O
top  O
resembles  O
those  O
Chee  O

3.8/5  O
My  O
partner  O
was  O
famished  O
so  O
she  O
ordered  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
Rice  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
pork  O
was  O
beautifully  O
marinated  O
and  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
dry  O
to  O
our  O
likings  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
loved  O
thesalted  O
egg  O
pudding  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
's  O
meatball  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
also  O
chye  O

in  O
it  O

4.2/5  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
something  O
light  O
as  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
heavy  O
breakfast  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Fish  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
(  O

)  O
.  O

I  O
called  O

the  O

Therewere  O
ingredients  O
stuffed  O
with  O
fish  O
pastes  O
,  O
fish  O
balls  O
,  O
fish  O
slices  O
and  O
vegetables  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Vietnamese  O
rice  O
vermicelli  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
silky  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
delectable  O
with  O
the  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
soup  O
.  O

has  O
always  O

to  O
opena  O
seafood  O
restaurant  O
himself  O
too  O
but  O
he  O
could  O
not  O
find  O
a  O

location  O
until  O
the  O

came  O
along  O

The  O

I  O

told  O
that  O
all  O

on  O

These  O
Wasabi  O
Chips  O
were  O
very  O
addictive  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
dinner  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
.  O

Although  O
Majestic  O
Bay  O
is  O
a  O
seafood  O

,  O
dim  O

is  O
available  O
during  O

.  O

The  O
dim  O

are  O
created  O
by  O

Li  O
Shou  O

who  O

Pork  O

(  O

)  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
bun  O
was  O
sugar  O
glazed  O
and  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
spongy  O
and  O
soft  O
like  O
cotton  O
.  O

It  O
felt  O
like  O
my  O
teeth  O
sunk  O
into  O
a  O

,  O
the  O

This  O

into  O
traditional  O

is  O
an  O
alternative  O

Crab  O
4.2/5  O
Chef  O
Yong  O
wanted  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
crab  O
dish  O
that  O
is  O
distinctively  O
Singapore  O
when  O
he  O
opened  O
Majestic  O
Bay  O
.  O

With  O
his  O
love  O
for  O
coffee  O
and  O
a  O
good  O
3  O
months  O
of  O
research  O
,  O
the  O

Signature  O
``  O

''  O
Sauce  O
Crab  O
(  O

price  O
)  O
is  O
born  O
.  O

The  O
special  O
coffee  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
blend  O
of  O
3  O
different  O
coffee  O
beans  O
.  O

Apple  O
jam  O
was  O
also  O
added  O
to  O
sweeten  O
it  O
.  O

Chinese  O
white  O
wine  O
is  O
poured  O
onto  O
the  O
crab  O
and  O
ignited  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
filling  O
the  O
restaurant  O
with  O
the  O
strong  O
coffee  O
aroma  O
.  O

This  O
probably  O
will  O
be  O
the  O
next  O
iconic  O
crab  O
dish  O
after  O
the  O
chilli  O
crab  O
,  O
black  O
pepper  O
crab  O
and  O

4.2/5  O
Another  O
signature  O

at  O

(  O
$  O

Served  O
and  O
presented  O
like  O
the  O
Spanish  O
paella  O
,  O
the  O
rice  O
was  O
first  O
fried  O
before  O
baking  O
in  O
cheese  O
.  O

A  O
fusion  O
dish  O
with  O
the  O
abundance  O
of  O
fresh  O
sea  O
treasures  O
and  O
the  O
bold  O
robust  O
flavours  O
got  O
the  O
approval  O
from  O
the  O

.  O

Sweet  O

4.2/5  O
Dessert  O
was  O
Sweet  O
Temptation  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
for  O
4  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
sweet  O
temptation  O
platter  O
comes  O
with  O
Black  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shredded  O

Egg  O
Yolk  O
and  O
Bay  O
's  O
Chinese  O
Pancake  O
with  O
Red  O
Bean  O
Paste  O
.  O

All  O
4  O
desserts  O
were  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
I  O
ca  O
n't  O
decide  O
which  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
probably  O
is  O
the  O
more  O
uncommon  O
among  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
dumping  O
comes  O
with  O
yam  O
paste  O
filling  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
having  O
both  O
Pulut  O
Hitam  O
and  O
Orh  O
Nee  O
in  O
one  O
dessert  O
.  O

Back  O
in  O
October  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
attended  O
the  O
monthly  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
which  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Forture  O
Seafood  O
Steamboat  O
along  O
Bukit  O
Timah  O
Road  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
a  O
few  O
of  O
the  O
regulars  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
2nd  O
time  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
is  O
held  O
here  O
because  O
the  O
former  O
chef  O
(  O
Ah  O
Loy  O
)  O
has  O
returned  O
to  O
helm  O
the  O
kitchen  O
again  O
.  O

Supreme  O
Dragon  O
&  O
Phoenix  O
Platter  O
4/5  O
The  O
dinner  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Supreme  O
Dragon  O
&  O
Phoenix  O
Platter  O
.  O

When  O
this  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
everyone  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
was  O
fascinated  O
by  O
the  O
colourful  O
pink  O
and  O
purple  O
sauces  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
they  O
were  O
strawberry  O
(  O
pink  O
)  O
and  O
dragon  O
fruit  O
(  O
purple  O
)  O
sauces  O
for  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
prawn  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
chicken  O
on  O
the  O
hand  O
was  O
dressed  O
in  O
a  O
lime  O
and  O
lemon  O
sauce  O
topped  O
with  O
sesame  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Fresh  O
Mushroom  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Fresh  O
Mushroom  O
was  O
nicely  O
executed  O
bringing  O
out  O
the  O
nature  O
earthy  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
fresh  O
mushroom  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Garoupa  O
in  O
Green  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
4/5  O
The  O
Steamed  O
Garoupa  O
in  O
Green  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
was  O
a  O
welcoming  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
cooking  O
styles  O
for  O
steamed  O
fish  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
steamed  O
perfectly  O
to  O
tender  O
soft  O
and  O
the  O
accompanying  O
green  O
curry  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
appetising  O
.  O

Stir-Fried  O
Vegetable  O
with  O
Dried  O
Scallops  O
3/5  O
The  O
Stir-Fried  O
Vegetable  O
with  O
Dried  O
Scallops  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
encountered  O
the  O
Qing  O
Long  O
Cai  O
literally  O
translated  O
as  O
Green  O
Dragon  O
Vegetable  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
chives  O
but  O
does  O
not  O
taste  O
like  O
it  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
toughness  O
of  O
the  O
dried  O
scallop  O
was  O
a  O
great  O
disappointment  O
which  O
was  O
the  O
downfall  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Salted  O
Baked  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
comforting  O
kampong  O
styleSalted  O
Baked  O
Chicken  O
was  O
delightful  O
addition  O
to  O
the  O
dinner  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
minced  O
sand  O
ginger  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
has  O
specially  O
imported  O
them  O
from  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

Our  O
table  O
was  O
raving  O
about  O
the  O
sauce  O
and  O
the  O
chef  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
give  O
us  O
some  O
to  O
bring  O
home  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Duck  O
Roll  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Crispy  O
Duck  O
Roll  O
was  O
inspired  O
by  O
the  O
popular  O
Beijing  O
Duck  O
.  O

The  O
succulentduck  O
sandwiched  O
between  O
2  O
thin  O
layers  O
of  O
pancake  O
skin  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
twist  O
by  O
the  O
chef  O
.  O

Braised  O
Herbal  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
4/5  O
The  O
Braised  O
Herbal  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
was  O
huge  O
!  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
herbally  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
not  O
overpowering  O
.  O

Crispy  O

4/5  O
Which  O
Zi  O
Cha  O
place  O
prepares  O
the  O
Hor  O

this  O
way  O
?  O

I  O
assume  O
ittakes  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
to  O
fry  O
the  O
hor  O
fun  O
to  O
such  O
a  O
beautiful  O
crisp  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
served  O
together  O
with  O
seafood  O
such  O
as  O
scallops  O
,  O
fish  O
maw  O
and  O
sea  O
cucumberwas  O
is  O
definitely  O
something  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
norm  O
and  O
worth  O
trying  O
.  O

Japanese  O

Wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
night  O
,  O
we  O
ended  O
our  O
dinner  O
with  O
a  O
Japanese  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
with  O
sago  O
dessert  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
Zi  O
Char  O
place  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
Forture  O
Seafood  O
Steamboat  O
is  O
a  O
notch  O
better  O
than  O
most  O
with  O
their  O
creativity  O
and  O
bold  O

in  O
their  O
dishes  O
.  O

For  O
inform  O
,  O
this  O
place  O
is  O
formally  O
known  O
as  O
Fortune  O
Seafood  O
.  O

They  O
dropped  O
the  O
``  O
N  O
''  O
and  O
replaced  O
it  O
with  O
``  O
R  O
''  O
after  O
fengshui  O
master  O
suggested  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
better  O
for  O
their  O
business  O

Back  O
in  O
September  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
a  O
5  O
days  O
trip  O
to  O
Taipei  O
seizing  O
on  O
a  O
1  O
for  O
1  O
Jetstar  O

ticket  O
promotion  O
.  O

Since  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
to  O
Taipei  O
a  O
couple  O
times  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
train  O
ride  O
down  O
to  O
Hualien  O
to  O
stay  O
at  O
Bayview  O
Hotel  O
(  O
)  O
after  O
seeing  O
all  O
the  O
beautiful  O
photos  O
on  O
my  O
friend  O
's  O
facebook  O
page  O
.  O

Upon  O
our  O
arrival  O
at  O
Hualien  O
train  O
station  O
,  O
the  O
hotel  O
staff  O
picked  O
us  O
up  O
together  O
with  O
another  O
Singaporean  O
couple  O
.  O

The  O
journey  O
from  O
the  O
train  O
station  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
took  O
about  O
10  O
minutes  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
were  O
still  O
early  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
,  O
we  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
's  O
cafe  O
next  O
door  O
to  O
rest  O
and  O
wait  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
explore  O
the  O
area  O
as  O
we  O
were  O
tiredafter  O
a  O
long  O
journey  O
travelling  O
on  O
plane  O
,  O
train  O
and  O
car  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
cafe  O
,  O
it  O
felt  O
as  O
if  O
I  O
am  O
in  O
Greece  O
.  O

Helping  O
ourselves  O
to  O
the  O
free  O
beverage  O
and  O
local  O
snacks  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
time  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
our  O
Deluxe  O
Familyroom  O
for  O
4  O
with  O
balcony  O
overlooking  O
the  O
pacific  O
ocean  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
Deluxe  O
Double  O
Room  O
is  O
fully  O
booked  O
,  O
the  O
hotel  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
offer  O
me  O
the  O
Deluxe  O
Family  O
Room  O
with  O
thesame  O
rate  O
for  O
the  O
Deluxe  O
Double  O
Room  O
.  O

Simply  O
love  O
the  O
white  O
and  O
tiffany  O
blue  O
combination  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
the  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
Pacific  O
Ocean  O
that  O
greeted  O
me  O
everyday  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
background  O
,  O
that  O
's  O
the  O
fishing  O
boat  O
that  O
will  O
bring  O
in  O
freshly  O
live  O
catch  O
everyday  O
.  O

The  O
viewof  O
the  O
popular  O
beach  O
,  O
Chi  O
Sing  O
Tan  O
(  O
)  O
was  O
just  O
stuning  O
is  O
n't  O
it  O
?  O

Next  O
morning  O
after  O
our  O
breakfast  O
,  O
we  O
rented  O
the  O
free  O
bicycle  O
from  O
the  O
hotel  O
and  O
went  O
biking  O
along  O
the  O
coastal  O
area  O
.  O

We  O
cycled  O
up  O
a  O
hill  O
top  O
to  O
catch  O
the  O
beautiful  O
bird  O
's  O
eye  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
beach  O
.  O

Along  O
the  O
cycling  O
track  O
,  O
we  O
also  O
saw  O
lots  O
of  O
pineapple  O
plantgrowing  O
alongside  O
the  O
track  O
.  O

Moving  O
in  O
shore  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
interesting  O
buidings  O
spotted  O
too  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
my  O
stay  O
at  O
Bayview  O
Hotel  O
at  O
Hualien  O
.  O

The  O
staffs  O
were  O
very  O
friendly  O
and  O
helpful  O
.  O

The  O
room  O
was  O
clean  O
too  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
Hualien  O
town  O
,  O
the  O
staff  O
can  O
help  O
you  O
arrange  O
a  O

tell  O
the  O
taxi  O
driver  O
the  O
time  O
and  O
place  O
to  O
pick  O

You  O
only  O
need  O

returning  O

fare  O
?  O

The  O
char  O
siew  O
and  O
wanton  O
were  O
quite  O
average  O
,  O
nothing  O
astonishing  O
.  O

The  O

the  O

a  O
faithful  O
followers  O
for  O
their  O
wanton  O
mee  O
all  O

be  O
the  O

and  O
the  O
special  O

that  O
was  O

The  O

of  O
the  O

deserved  O
my  O
return  O
again  O

Resting  O
on  O
the  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
was  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
wasabi  O
.  O

Mixing  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
chicken  O
broth  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
broth  O
an  O
unique  O
delectable  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
mild  O
wasabi  O
spiciness  O
.  O

The  O
tamago  O
egg  O
was  O
well  O
flavoured  O
and  O
not  O
too  O
salty  O
.  O

Special  O
4.2/5  O
Each  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
comes  O
with  O
the  O
standard  O
gigantic  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
is  O
defintiely  O
the  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
toasted  O
szechuan  O
peppercorn  O
and  O
garlic  O
in  O
oil  O
that  O
gave  O
the  O
chicken  O
broth  O
the  O
fragrant  O
toasty  O
aroma  O
.  O

Having  O
tried  O
both  O
Marutama  O
Ramen  O
and  O
Marukin  O
Ramen  O
Tokyo  O
that  O
used  O
chicken  O
stock  O
for  O
their  O
ramen  O
,  O
I  O
think  O
Chef  O
Keisuke  O
Takeda  O
nailed  O
his  O
version  O
.  O

While  O
chicken  O
stock  O
ramen  O
is  O
less  O
oily  O
and  O
lighter  O
,  O
Keisuke  O
Tori  O
King  O
's  O
broth  O
ismore  O
robust  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
generous  O
servicing  O
of  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
definitely  O
is  O
a  O
crowd  O
winner  O

food  O
scene  O
.  O

Kkhongdon  O
in  O
Korean  O
literally  O
means  O
best  O
price  O
value  O
.  O

The  O
history  O
started  O
back  O
with  O
the  O
first  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Sinchon  O
,  O
Seoul  O
in  O
January  O
2005  O
.  O

To  O
date  O
there  O
are  O
67  O
outlets  O
in  O
Korea  O
providing  O
high  O
quality  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
at  O
reasonable  O
price  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
nicely  O
spaced  O
withextendable  O
air  O
suction  O
pipe  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
an  O
air  O
purifier  O
placed  O
in  O
corner  O
to  O
freshen  O
the  O
air  O
in  O
the  O
restaurantso  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
smell  O
like  O
BBQ  O
after  O
dining  O
.  O

Free  O
flow  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Korean  O
side  O
dishes  O
are  O
available  O
at  O
the  O
buffet  O
counter  O
but  O
rather  O
limited  O
selections  O
.  O

Aaron  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
cooked  O
us  O
some  O
kimchi  O
and  O
bean  O
sprouts  O
saying  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
warm  O
.  O

Indeed  O
it  O
did  O
and  O
I  O
will  O
do  O
so  O
when  O
I  O
next  O
visit  O
another  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Raspberry  O
Rice  O
Wine  O
3/5  O
As  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
something  O
different  O
on  O
the  O
beverage  O
menu  O
,  O
Aaron  O
recommended  O
me  O
the  O
Raspberry  O
Rice  O
Wine  O
360ml  O
(  O
$  O
19  O
)  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
should  O
have  O
just  O
stick  O
to  O
my  O
beer  O
.  O

Beef  O
Skirt  O
4/5  O
Beef  O
Fingers  O
4/5  O
On  O
the  O
beef  O
menu  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
both  O
the  O
Beef  O
Skirt  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
and  O
Beef  O
Fingers  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
directly  O
imported  O
from  O
JP  O
Pepperdine  O
's  O
own  O
Silver  O
FernFarmsin  O
New  O
Zealand  O
.  O

These  O
are  O
the  O
same  O
beefused  O
for  O
Jack  O
Place  O
's  O
steak  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Pork  O
Belly  O
4/5  O
Knowing  O
my  O
weakest  O
for  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
always  O
prefer  O
them  O
over  O
the  O
beef  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
fat  O
and  O
meat  O
when  O
grilled  O
were  O
simply  O
sizzling  O
yummy  O
.  O

Spicy  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
4/5  O
They  O
have  O
the  O
spicy  O
version  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
Spicy  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
just  O
as  O
good  O
but  O
it  O
wasa  O
bit  O
too  O
mild  O
in  O
the  O
spices  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
get  O
the  O
hot  O
rush  O
I  O
was  O
expecting  O
.  O

Bibimbap  O
3.5/5  O
Beside  O
the  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
offers  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
prepared  O
by  O
the  O
lady  O
Korean  O
chef  O
.  O

Beinga  O
rice  O
person  O
,  O
the  O
Bibimbap  O
was  O
served  O
at  O
the  O
right  O
time  O
to  O
fill  O
my  O
stomach  O
.  O

We  O
asked  O
Aaron  O
how  O
come  O
there  O
was  O
no  O
egg  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
served  O
in  O
hot  O
stone  O
?  O

He  O
told  O
us  O
this  O
is  O
from  O
the  O
lunch  O
set  O
menu  O
.  O

Without  O
the  O
hot  O
stone  O
cooking  O
the  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
crisp  O
and  O
burnt  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
was  O
missingwhich  O
was  O
the  O
delectable  O
part  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Pancake  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Seafood  O
Pancake  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crust  O
on  O
both  O
the  O
top  O
and  O
bottom  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
fluffy.Topped  O
with  O
seafood  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
a  O
sumptuous  O
pancake  O
.  O

Kimchi  O
Pancake  O
3.8/5  O
For  O
kimchi  O
lover  O
,  O
the  O
Kimchi  O
Pancake  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
)  O
is  O
definitely  O
one  O
pancake  O
for  O
you  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
kimchi  O
in  O
between  O
the  O
flour  O
batter  O
,  O
each  O
bite  O
of  O
the  O
crunchy  O
kimchi  O
inside  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

Ginseng  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O
It  O
was  O
a  O
cold  O
night  O
and  O
the  O
Ginseng  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
was  O
perfect  O
for  O
warming  O
the  O
body  O
.  O

A  O
well  O
executed  O
dish  O
that  O
was  O
hearty  O
and  O
comforting  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
want  O
to  O
be  O
picky  O
,  O
the  O
soup  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
ginseng  O
flavour  O
.  O

Kimchi  O
and  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Stew  O
Hotpot  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Stew  O
Hotpot  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
popular  O
Korean  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
well  O
fermented  O
kimchi  O
with  O
tasty  O
pork  O
belly  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
in  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
spicy  O
broth  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
tender  O
pork  O
belly  O
,  O
the  O
hotpot  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
soft  O
and  O
silky  O
tofu  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Egg  O
4/5  O
The  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
quite  O
flavourful  O
with  O
custard  O
like  O
texture  O
topped  O
with  O
scallions  O
and  O
carrots  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
tellwhat  O
's  O
the  O
broth  O
used  O
to  O
thin  O
the  O
egg  O
mixture  O
but  O
it  O
definitely  O
lifted  O
the  O
taste  O
and  O
dimension  O
of  O
this  O
humble  O
dish  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
think  O
Kkongdon  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
is  O
worth  O
a  O
visit  O
with  O
good  O
quality  O
meat  O
.  O

On  O
top  O
of  O
that  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
good  O
selection  O
of  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
.  O

It  O
would  O
be  O
nice  O
if  O
they  O
can  O
expand  O
the  O
selection  O
of  O
free  O
flow  O
kimchi  O
and  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
left  O
the  O
restaurant  O
smelling  O
of  O
BBQ  O
so  O
it  O
probably  O
need  O
to  O
install  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
air  O
purifiers  O

the  O
event  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
sleepless  O
nights  O
and  O
kept  O
askingeach  O
otherwhether  O
we  O
will  O
ever  O
do  O
it  O
again  O
?  O

I  O
will  O
leave  O
the  O
answer  O
to  O
the  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
post  O
cause  O
we  O
ourselves  O
said  O
this  O
to  O
each  O
other  O
,  O
``  O
ask  O
me  O
again  O
after  O
the  O
event  O
''  O
.  O

Those  O
that  O
follow  O
our  O
blogs  O
will  O
know  O
that  O
we  O
organised  O
regular  O
makan  O
trails  O
and  O
the  O
latest  O
was  O
a  O
hawker  O
trail  O
to  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Market  O
and  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Usually  O
these  O
makan  O
gatherings  O
were  O
kept  O
to  O
a  O
closely  O
knitted  O
group  O
of  O
friends  O
and  O
a  O
manageable  O
size  O
of  O
20-30  O
pax  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
for  O
this  O
makan  O
gathering  O
,  O
we  O
made  O
a  O
brave  O
decision  O
to  O
open  O
it  O
up  O
to  O
EVERYONE  O
.  O

Through  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
tasting  O
sessions  O
,  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
know  O
Kennie  O
from  O
High  O
Societyand  O
we  O
thought  O
maybe  O
we  O
can  O
do  O
a  O
sit  O
down  O
dinner  O
instead  O
of  O
the  O
usual  O
hawker  O
trails  O
.  O

Kennie  O
was  O
very  O
receptive  O
and  O
supportive  O
of  O
our  O
idea  O
and  O
a  O
menu  O
was  O
soon  O
drawn  O
upfora  O
fix  O
price  O
of  O
$  O
35  O
per  O
pax  O
.  O

The  O
initial  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
limit  O
the  O
makan  O
gathering  O
to  O
40  O
pax  O
but  O
as  O
we  O
sent  O
out  O
the  O
invites  O
on  O
facebook  O
,  O
we  O
realized  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
so  O
many  O
wonderful  O
friends  O
along  O
our  O
blogging  O
journey  O
and  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
with  O
70+  O
pax  O
in  O
our  O
invitation  O

November  O
2012  O
.  O

Worried  O
that  O
we  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
host  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
bring  O
in  O
sponsors  O
so  O
everyone  O
has  O
something  O
to  O
bring  O
backfor  O
coming  O
to  O
the  O
Makan  O
Gathering  O
.  O

We  O
are  O
very  O
thankfulto  O
Huiji  O
,  O
Gold  O
Kili  O
,  O
Frezfruita  O
,  O
Mouth  O
Restaurant  O
and  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Beach  O
Road  O
for  O
the  O
sponsorship  O
.  O

Thank  O
you  O
Faith  O
,  O
Daniel  O
and  O
Karen  O
too  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photo  O
above  O
,  O
these  O
were  O
the  O
boxes  O
of  O
goodies  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
transport  O
to  O
the  O
venue  O
.  O

The  O
honey  O
weights  O
1KG  O
and  O
there  O
were  O
60  O
bottles  O
=  O
60KG  O
!  O

These  O
could  O
not  O
be  O
possible  O
without  O
the  O
help  O
from  O
Sherie  O
,  O
Yancai  O
and  O
Chuan  O
Kai  O
.  O

Both  O
Maureen  O
and  O
me  O
came  O
out  O
from  O
out  O
own  O
pockets  O
to  O
get  O
the  O
paper  O
bag  O
for  O
the  O
goodies  O
as  O
we  O
could  O
not  O
find  O
sponsor  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

Each  O
bag  O
cost  O
us  O
$  O
1  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
spend  O
$  O
60  O
getting  O
them  O
.  O

The  O
worst  O
nightmare  O
was  O
the  O
paper  O
bag  O
could  O
not  O
hold  O
the  O
weight  O
of  O
the  O
goodies  O
and  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
have  O
a  O
few  O
broken  O
kaya  O
bottles  O
.  O

Thank  O
goodness  O
no  O
one  O
was  O
hurt  O
and  O
we  O
apologize  O
for  O
the  O
unfortunate  O
incident  O
.  O

High  O
Society  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
our  O
rescue  O
providing  O
us  O
with  O
another  O
50  O
plastic  O
bags  O
.  O

Thank  O
you  O

the  O
staff  O
for  O
cleaning  O
up  O
the  O
mess  O
too  O
.  O

Even  O
Maureen  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
aboutthis  O
as  O
I  O
composite  O
this  O
paragraph  O
.  O

Since  O
I  O
was  O
the  O
only  O
one  O
that  O
arrived  O
early  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
preparation  O
work  O
cause  O
she  O
was  O
held  O
up  O
by  O
traffic  O
transporting  O
the  O
goodies  O
,  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
meeting  O
with  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
on  O
the  O
flow  O
of  O
the  O
serve  O
and  O
how  O
we  O
can  O
help  O
the  O
kitchen  O
to  O
get  O
out  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
to  O
everyone  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O

and  O
Jiayi  O
who  O
came  O
early  O
and  O
helped  O

the  O
registration  O
.  O

They  O
played  O
a  O
major  O
role  O
intaking  O
each  O
individual  O
's  O
main  O
order  O
,  O
tallying  O
them  O
for  O
each  O
table  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
communicate  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
and  O
hence  O
the  O
kitchen  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
staffs  O
at  O
High  O
Society  O
for  O
getting  O
all  O
62  O
mains  O
out  O
to  O
everyone  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O
operations  O
flow  O
was  O
smooth  O
and  O
no  O
one  O
had  O
to  O
wait  O
long  O
for  O
their  O
food  O
.  O

Following  O
the  O
62  O

this  O
was  O

a  O

savoury  O
concept  O
bringing  O
you  O
SOFRIES  O
at  O
the  O
newly  O
opened  O
Star  O

beside  O
Buona  O
Vista  O

station  O
.  O

Similar  O
toSogurt  O
's  O
concept  O
of  O
empowering  O
the  O
choices  O
to  O
the  O
customers  O
,  O
at  O
SOFRIES  O
you  O
get  O
to  O
select  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
fries  O
and  O
pair  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
many  O
dipping  O
sauces  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

On  O
their  O
menu  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
4  O
types  O

Cereal  O
Fries  O
4/5  O
The  O
Cereal  O
Fries  O
was  O
the  O
most  O
interesting  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
anything  O
like  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
nothing  O
like  O
fries  O
yet  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
in  O
its  O
own  O
unique  O
taste  O
and  O
texture  O
.  O

Our  O
host  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
some  O
people  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
too  O
sweet  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
think  O
so  O
.  O

Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
was  O
more  O
familiar  O
to  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
straight  O
cut  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
nature  O
sweetness  O
would  O
always  O
be  O
my  O
preferred  O
choice  O
over  O
the  O
normal  O
potato  O
fries  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
sauces  O

,  O
Green  O
Apple  O
Balsamic  O
Syrup  O
was  O
another  O
exquisite  O

in  O
the  O

out  O
for  O
its  O
exemplary  O

the  O

Another  O
item  O
from  O
the  O
degustation  O
menu  O
,  O
the  O
Cappucino  O
of  O
Mushroom  O
was  O
interesting  O
presented  O
in  O
a  O
coffee  O
cup  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
drank  O
as  O
if  O
one  O
was  O
drinking  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
coffee  O
.  O

Packed  O
with  O
mushroomy  O
flavours  O
I  O

it  O
was  O
let  O
down  O
by  O
just  O
a  O
pinch  O
too  O
much  O
salt  O
.  O

very  O
memorable  O

The  O
pasta  O
resembles  O
the  O
Chinese  O
version  O
of  O
``  O

Kia  O
Ta  O
''  O
was  O
a  O
pure  O
enjoyment  O
both  O
in  O

and  O
textures  O
.  O

I  O
will  O
definitely  O
order  O

looked  O
simple  O

was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours.Unlike  O
the  O
normal  O
sticky  O

,  O
Chef  O

version  O
kept  O
the  O
Acquerello  O

intact  O
without  O

retained  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
Sirloin  O
steak  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
succulent  O
and  O
beautiful  O

ate  O
it  O

be  O
having  O
the  O

very  O
nice  O
to  O

a  O

If  O

the  O

cooked  O
was  O
for  O
the  O
Cook  O
For  O

This  O

favourite  O
dishes  O
.  O

She  O
has  O
cooked  O
this  O
for  O
me  O
once  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
would  O
try  O
to  O
make  O
it  O
and  O
cook  O
for  O
her  O
next  O
time  O
.  O

The  O
minced  O

Steamed  O
Fish  O
with  O
Green  O
Kiwi  O
Inspired  O
by  O
Ellena  O
aka  O
Cuisine  O
Paradise  O
,  O
I  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
in  O
using  O
kiwi  O
to  O
steam  O
fish  O
.  O

Use  O
only  O
green  O
kiwi  O
and  O
not  O
yellow  O
kiwi  O
,  O
also  O
choose  O
one  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
too  O
ripe  O
so  O
that  O
the  O
kiwi  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
too  O
mushy  O
after  O
steaming  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Fish  O
with  O
Green  O
Kiwi  O
Simply  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
taste  O
and  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
steamed  O
fish  O
using  O
green  O
kiwi  O
.  O

The  O
green  O
kiwi  O
after  O
steaming  O
will  O
have  O
a  O
sour  O
flavour  O
similar  O
to  O
sour  O
(  O
salted  O
)  O
plum  O
commonly  O
used  O
for  O
steaming  O
fish  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
like  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
sour  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
a  O
few  O
slices  O
of  O
tomatoes  O
.  O

wrapping  O
around  O
the  O

both  O
in  O
visual  O
and  O

.  O

The  O
Japanese  O

a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
texture  O

MentaiCheese  O
Chigiri  O
Age  O
3/5  O
Initally  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
Mentai  O
Cheese  O
Chigiri  O
Age  O
(  O
$  O
9.80  O
)  O
was  O
chicken  O
bites  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
actually  O
fishcake  O
of  O
spicy  O
seasoned  O
cod  O
roe  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
something  O
I  O
would  O
not  O
usually  O
find  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
or  O
ordered  O
in  O
a  O
Japanese  O
restaurant  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
quite  O
pedestrian  O
for  O

The  O

The  O

Even  O

was  O
pan  O
fried  O
,  O
themeat  O
in  O
thefilling  O
was  O
tender  O

best  O
Gyoza  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

for  O

.  O

The  O
chef  O
demonstrated  O
how  O
by  O
controlling  O
the  O

of  O

can  O
bring  O
out  O
different  O
flavours  O
and  O
tastes  O
of  O

The  O
Frog  O

with  O
Spring  O

(  O

is  O
my  O
favourite  O
among  O
all  O
the  O
different  O
cooking  O
styles  O
of  O
the  O
frog  O
porridge  O
.  O

It  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
thick  O
sweet  O

spicy  O
sauce  O
that  O
complements  O
the  O
Cantonese  O
style  O

very  O
well  O

not  O

which  O
is  O
located  O

The  O

a  O
good  O
varieties  O
of  O

as  O
well  O
as  O

wares  O
while  O
the  O
upper  O

are  O
tea  O
chambers  O
while  O
friends  O
can  O
gather  O
for  O
some  O
tea  O
and  O
snacks  O
.  O

Chinese  O

is  O
generally  O
categorised  O
into  O
black  O
tea  O
(  O

,  O
oolong  O

Basically  O
there  O
are  O
also  O
2  O
type  O
of  O
tea  O
set  O
which  O
is  O
used  O
to  O

is  O

We  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
3  O
types  O
of  O
tea  O
namely  O
Silver  O
Tea  O
Leaf  O
(  O

,  O
Imperial  O
Huangjin  O

(  O

and  O

(  O
)  O
.  O

Very  O
interestingly  O
,  O
each  O
tea  O
leaf  O
has  O
a  O
legendary  O
story  O
behind  O
it  O
.  O

Takefor  O
example  O
theDa  O
Hong  O
Pao  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
about  O
a  O
topscholar  O
who  O
protected  O
the  O
tea  O
tree  O
with  O
his  O
red  O
robe  O
in  O
a  O
stormy  O
night  O
.  O

He  O
was  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
temple  O
to  O
express  O
his  O
thanks  O
to  O
the  O
abbot  O
who  O
took  O
care  O
of  O
him  O
when  O
he  O
fell  O
sick  O
on  O
his  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
imperial  O
exam  O
.  O

The  O
abbot  O
brewed  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
tea  O
for  O
him  O
to  O
drink  O
and  O
he  O
soon  O
recovered  O
.  O

Eventually  O
took  O
his  O
exam  O
and  O
became  O
top  O
scholar  O
that  O
year  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
art  O
of  O
tea  O
brewing  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
also  O
learnt  O
about  O
postures  O
and  O
the  O
ways  O
of  O
hold  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
between  O
male  O
and  O
female  O
.  O

Above  O
pictures  O
are  O
the  O
way  O
how  O
the  O
male  O
should  O
be  O
holding  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
.  O

And  O
above  O
is  O
how  O
the  O
female  O
holds  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
read  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
well  O
versed  O
in  O
the  O
art  O
and  O
culture  O
of  O
tea  O
appreciation  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
interested  O
in  O

appreciation  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
drop  O

A  O
favourite  O
and  O
household  O
dish  O
in  O
Taiwan  O
,  O
the  O
history  O
of  O
Changhua  O
Meatballs  O
dated  O
back  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
back  O
186  O
years  O
ago  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
created  O
using  O
sweet  O
potato  O
flour  O
and  O
pieces  O
of  O
meat  O
when  O
northern  O
Taiwan  O
was  O
hit  O
by  O
flood  O
and  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
shortage  O
of  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
recipe  O
has  O
grew  O
in  O
popularity  O
nationwide  O
,  O
revised  O
and  O
improved  O
over  O
the  O
years  O
.  O

The  O
Zhang  O
Hua  O
Meatball  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
served  O
at  O
Shin  O
Yeh  O
had  O
a  O
very  O
``  O
Q  O

soft  O
and  O
chewy  O
texture  O
stuffed  O
with  O
a  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
meat  O
fillings  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
had  O
also  O
been  O
fine  O
tuned  O
to  O
be  O
less  O
sweet  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
spiciness  O
to  O
it  O
which  O
complemented  O
the  O
meatball  O
perfectly  O

Fish  O
(  O

)  O
which  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
so  O
soft  O
that  O
it  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
.  O

The  O
unique  O
name  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
tendency  O
of  O
the  O
fish  O
turning  O
white  O
as  O
milk  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
cooked  O
and  O
its  O
spotless  O

abdomen  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
told  O
that  O
the  O
fish  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
bones  O
and  O
usually  O
only  O
eat  O
the  O

I  O
was  O
back  O
at  O
the  O

with  O
my  O

to  O

the  O

after  O
the  O

at  O

We  O
decided  O
to  O

out  O

since  O
we  O
did  O

We  O
order  O

Interestingly  O
the  O

uses  O
large  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
to  O
hold  O
the  O

.  O

These  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
is  O
from  O
Japan  O
and  O
absorbs  O
impurities  O
from  O
the  O
meat  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
amazing  O
that  O
the  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
can  O
stay  O
intact  O
after  O
all  O
the  O

cooking  O

Both  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
and  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
were  O
beautiful  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
they  O
were  O

thinly  O
sliced  O
for  O

enjoyment  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
rather  O
bland  O
but  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
vegetables  O
were  O
brought  O
to  O

The  O
lovely  O
and  O
hearty  O
dinner  O
however  O
was  O
spolit  O
by  O
some  O
unexpected  O
experience  O
.  O

First  O
of  O
all  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
rice  O
at  O
7pm  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
absurd  O
considermost  O
of  O
the  O
walk  O
in  O
customers  O
asked  O
for  O
rice  O
and  O
some  O
even  O
walked  O
away  O
when  O
told  O
no  O
more  O
rice  O
is  O
served  O
.  O

Why  O
ca  O
n't  O
they  O
cook  O
some  O
rice  O
since  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
early  O
from  O
closing  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
even  O
supermarket  O
just  O
down  O
the  O
corridor  O
.  O

We  O
could  O
see  O
that  O
a  O
few  O
customers  O
were  O
quite  O
upset  O
when  O
they  O
could  O
n't  O
have  O
another  O
refill  O
that  O
include  O
myself  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
have  O
a  O
little  O
commotion  O
who  O
I  O
think  O
is  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
.  O

She  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
discourage  O
us  O
from  O
using  O
the  O
voucher  O
although  O
they  O
participated  O
in  O
the  O
Japan  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
week  O
organised  O
by  O
the  O
shopping  O
centre  O
,  O
saying  O
it  O
is  O
hard  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
claim  O
from  O
the  O
mall  O
's  O
management  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
end  O
we  O
just  O
gave  O
her  O
the  O
vouchers  O
and  O
left  O
since  O
she  O
claimed  O
that  O
the  O
most  O
she  O
treated  O
it  O
as  O
if  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
free  O
meal  O

's  O
first  O

restaurant  O
celebrates  O
its  O
10anniversary  O
this  O
year  O
.  O

While  O
waiting  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
bloggers  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
a  O
delectabe  O
trio  O
of  O
canapes  O
that  O
showcased  O
the  O
artistic  O
endeavour  O
reflected  O
in  O
My  O
Humble  O
House  O
's  O
cuisine  O
,  O
design  O
,  O
service  O
and  O
attention  O
to  O
detail  O
.  O

Popping  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Roll  O
canape  O
into  O
the  O
mouth  O
came  O
with  O
abundance  O
of  O
freshness  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
delectable  O
sauce  O
that  O
married  O
everything  O
together  O
.  O

Chicken  O
rice  O
as  O
a  O
canape  O
is  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
amazedthat  O
ourlocal  O
delicacy  O
can  O
be  O
presented  O
exquisitely  O
as  O
a  O
sushi  O
canape  O
.  O

The  O
canape  O
even  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
dash  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
that  O
completes  O
the  O
whole  O
meal  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
canape  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
amongthe  O
bloggers  O
.  O

The  O
balance  O
of  O
texture  O
and  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
XO  O
sauce  O
was  O
lovely  O
executed  O
.  O

Next  O
up  O
we  O
have  O
Senior  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
Ken  O
Ling  O
and  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
David  O
Liew  O
demonstrated  O
to  O
us  O
2  O
winning  O
dishes  O
at  O
this  O
year  O
Epicurean  O
Star  O
Award  O
.  O

Uniquely  O
TungLok  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
have  O
seen  O
and  O
triedBlack  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

The  O
first  O
dish  O
prepared  O
by  O
the  O
2  O
executive  O
chefs  O
was  O
Pan-seared  O
Maotai  O
Wine-marinated  O
Chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
wrapped  O
in  O
Black  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
,  O
chicken  O
breast  O
meat  O
paste  O
and  O
foie  O
gras  O
were  O
molded  O
into  O
a  O
rectangle  O
shape  O
before  O
being  O
pan-seared  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
then  O
placed  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
homemade  O
black  O
sesame  O
crepe  O
with  O
romaine  O
lettuce  O
,  O
cripsy  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
,  O
leek  O
,  O
ginger  O
flower  O
,  O
peanut  O
crumbs  O
,  O
black  O
sesame  O
and  O
mustard  O
glazed  O
suckling  O
pig  O
sauce  O
.  O

After  O
the  O
demonstration  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
giving  O
the  O
ingredients  O
to  O
plate  O
it  O
ourself  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Pan-seared  O
Maotai  O
Wine-marinated  O
Chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
wrapped  O
in  O
Black  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
who  O
does  O
not  O
take  O
foie  O
gras  O
commented  O
that  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
the  O
acquire  O
taste  O
and  O
she  O
was  O
happy  O
to  O
finish  O
everything  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
creativity  O
of  O
the  O
black  O
sesame  O
crepe  O
which  O
was  O
soft  O
,  O
smooth  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
secondwinning  O
dish  O
the  O
two  O
chefs  O
put  O
together  O
for  O
us  O
was  O
the  O
Soft  O
Red  O
Bean  O
Banana  O
Ball  O
coated  O
in  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
served  O
on  O
Chilled  O
Tropical  O
Fruits  O
with  O
Crushed  O
Coconut-flavoured  O
Ice  O
with  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
surprisingly  O
long  O
name  O
for  O
a  O
dish  O
considering  O
the  O
chinese  O
name  O
for  O
the  O
dish  O
only  O
has  O
7  O
characters  O
,  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
ball  O
or  O
rice  O
dumpling  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
of  O
the  O
coconut  O
husk  O
bowl  O
was  O
stuffed  O
with  O
banana  O
cubes  O
and  O
red  O
bean  O
paste  O
.  O

The  O
lovely  O
dessert  O
was  O
like  O
compact  O
coconut  O
platter  O
.  O

The  O
coconut  O
ice  O
cream  O
was  O
made  O
from  O
pure  O
coconut  O
juice  O
,  O
coconut  O
milk  O
,  O
pandan  O
leaf  O
and  O
sugar  O
bringing  O
it  O
to  O
a  O
boil  O
until  O
mixture  O
thicken  O
and  O
refrigerate  O
for  O
8  O
hours  O
.  O

The  O
coconut  O
flesh  O
was  O
also  O
deep  O
fry  O
to  O
crispy  O
to  O
give  O
texture.The  O
chef  O
also  O
painstakingly  O
removed  O
the  O
husk  O
making  O
it  O
into  O
a  O
bowl  O
so  O
customers  O
canenjoy  O
the  O
coconut  O
fresh  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
management  O
asked  O
me  O
whether  O
I  O
have  O
visited  O
My  O
Humble  O
House  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
bad  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
considering  O
it  O
is  O
into  O
its  O
10  O
anniversary  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
very  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
effort  O
behind  O
each  O
dish  O
and  O
the  O
artistic  O
presentation  O
of  O
them  O
.  O

Attention  O
to  O
details  O
were  O
also  O
put  O
into  O
each  O
dish  O
.  O

Thai  O
Papaya  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O
Compared  O
to  O
the  O
glass  O
noodle  O
salad  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Papaya  O
Salad  O
was  O
more  O
flavoursome  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
fearsome  O
kick  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Like  O
the  O
glass  O
noodle  O
salad  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
them  O
to  O
have  O
a  O

A  O
common  O
street  O
food  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O

was  O
given  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
by  O
the  O
kitchen  O
of  O
Plaza  O

.  O

The  O
lightly  O
breaded  O
version  O
of  O
the  O

with  O
its  O
outer  O
crisp  O

Thai  O
Fish  O
Maw  O
Soup  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Thai  O
Fish  O
Maw  O
Soup  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
savoury  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
servedright  O
in  O
time  O
to  O
cool  O
off  O
my  O
palate  O
after  O
having  O
all  O
the  O
spicy  O
food  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
being  O
told  O
itwas  O
Thai  O
fish  O
maw  O
soup  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
reallypointoutthe  O
difference  O
between  O

Thai  O
Beef  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Thai  O
Beef  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
group  O
.  O

The  O
excellent  O
broth  O
was  O
accompanied  O
with  O
tender  O
beef  O
and  O
bouncy  O
beef  O
balls  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
thick  O
but  O
thin  O
rice  O
noodles  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O

about  O
the  O

,  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
was  O
the  O
Thai  O
Red  O
Duck  O
Curry  O
.  O

It  O
may  O
sound  O
weird  O
to  O
have  O
roast  O
duck  O
meat  O
in  O
Thai  O
red  O
curry  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
balanced  O
and  O
flavoursome  O

was  O
calling  O
out  O
for  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O

Once  O
again  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O

was  O
a  O

documentary  O
show  O
and  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
Okinawan  O
cuisine  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
influence  O
from  O
the  O
Chinese  O
and  O
Southeast  O
Asian  O
cuisines  O
due  O
to  O
trade  O
in  O
the  O
early  O
dates  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
difference  O
in  O
culture  O
,  O
climate  O
,  O
vegetables  O
and  O
other  O
ingredients  O
between  O
Okinawan  O
and  O
mainland  O
Japan  O
,  O
Okinawan  O
cuisine  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
mainland  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Crispy  O
River  O
Shrimp  O
4/5  O
We  O
started  O
with  O
some  O
bites  O
and  O
starters  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
our  O
mains  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
River  O
Shrimp  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
suggested  O
by  O
Zhihao  O
who  O
has  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

Really  O
interesting  O
crispy  O
bites  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
saltiness  O
.  O

Be  O
warned  O
to  O
be  O
careful  O
while  O
eating  O
these  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
not  O
careful  O
and  O
the  O
claw  O
got  O
stuck  O
into  O
my  O
gum  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
removing  O
it  O
.  O

Vinegared  O
Mozuku  O
Seaweed  O
3.8/5  O
Initially  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Green  O
Caviar  O
Seaweed  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Sea  O
Grapes  O
but  O
they  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
stock  O
that  O
day  O
.  O

Hence  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
having  O
the  O
Vinegared  O
Mozuku  O
Seaweed  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
seaweed  O
was  O
a  O
refreshing  O
starter  O
for  O
a  O
beautiful  O
meal  O
waiting  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

really  O

As  O
I  O

all  O

was  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
``  O

(  O
Malay  O
expression  O
to  O
denote  O
extreme  O
weariness  O
and  O

The  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O

was  O
simply  O
``  O

.  O

As  O
you  O

see  O
,  O
the  O

has  O
the  O
influence  O
of  O

is  O

The  O
French  O

Soup  O
(  O

was  O
decent  O
but  O
not  O
awesome  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
really  O
taste  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O

The  O

meat  O
was  O
so  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
that  O
it  O
slipped  O
off  O
with  O

with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O

was  O
also  O
interesting  O
and  O

Unfortunately  O
our  O
chicken  O
was  O
a  O
little  O

raw  O
at  O
the  O

steak  O
brought  O
a  O
smile  O
to  O
our  O
face  O
.  O

The  O
Ribeye  O
Steak  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
was  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Australian  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Tomahawk  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
70-day  O
grained-fed  O
,  O
wet-aged  O
,  O
young  O
Black  O
Angus  O
cut  O
is  O
thus  O
named  O
for  O
its  O
resemblance  O
to  O
a  O
Native  O
Amercian  O
Indian  O
battle  O
axe  O
or  O
tomahawk  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
looked  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
baseball  O
bat  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
how  O
gigantic  O
the  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Tomahawk  O
(  O
$  O
125  O
)  O
is  O
.  O

The  O
massive  O
whole  O
rib  O
steak  O
weights  O
a  O
good  O
1.1kg  O
to  O
1.3kg  O
with  O
bone  O
in  O
and  O
is  O
served  O
medium  O
rare  O
after  O
20  O
minutes  O
in  O
the  O
broiler  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
understand  O
the  O
difficulty  O
in  O
cooking  O
such  O
a  O
big  O
pieces  O
of  O
cut  O
.  O

The  O
doneness  O
was  O
rather  O
inconsistent  O
.  O

Since  O
the  O
huge  O
portion  O
is  O
meant  O
to  O
be  O
shared  O
,  O
maybe  O
it  O
will  O
satisfy  O
the  O
different  O
preference  O
of  O
doneness  O
for  O
the  O
table  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
weak  O
in  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
was  O
rather  O
chewy  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
ribeye  O
more  O
than  O
the  O
tomahawk  O
.  O

Grilled  O

Sauteed  O
Kiplfer  O
Potatoes  O
4.2/5  O
Creamy  O
Corn  O
(  O
background  O
)  O
4/5  O
To  O
complete  O
the  O
meal  O
,  O
all  O
steakhouses  O
offer  O
a  O
line-up  O
of  O
side  O
dishes  O
so  O
does  O
Wooloomooloo  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
session  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
tried  O
3  O
of  O
their  O
signature  O
sides  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
Sauteed  O
Kiplfer  O
Potatoes  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
,  O
Creamy  O
Corn  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
and  O
Grilled  O
Asparagus  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
Sauteed  O
Kiplfer  O
Potatoes  O
,  O
nicely  O
seasoned  O
,  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

Pavlova  O
4/5  O
Wooloomooloo  O
offers  O
11  O
desserts  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
n't  O
much  O
room  O
left  O
to  O
indulge  O
in  O
all  O
the  O
11  O
variety  O
of  O
desserts  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
I  O
still  O
got  O
my  O
sweet  O
fix  O
in  O
the  O
Pavlova  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
with  O
Chantilly  O
Cream  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
the  O
meringue-based  O
dessert  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
crisp  O
and  O
crunchy  O
outer  O
crust  O
and  O
soft  O
,  O
moist  O
marshmallow  O
like  O

Bread  O
and  O
Butter  O
Pudding  O
4/5  O
The  O
Bread  O
and  O
Butter  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
freshly  O
baked  O
vanilla  O
bread  O
pudding  O
,  O
pastry  O
cream  O
,  O
homemade  O
praline  O
and  O
a  O
scoop  O
of  O
vanilla  O
gelato  O
.  O

A  O
lovely  O
dessert  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
night  O
with  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

Wooloomooloo  O
Steakhouse  O
has  O
an  O
inviting  O
,  O
relax  O
and  O
casual  O
ambience  O
although  O
it  O
is  O
labelled  O
as  O
a  O
premium  O
steakhouses  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
steak  O
which  O
I  O
understand  O
some  O
people  O
does  O
not  O
take  O
beef  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
offers  O
other  O
scrumptious  O
selection  O
including  O
specialities  O
such  O
as  O
Pan-Seared  O
Barramundi  O
Fillet  O
(  O
$  O
52  O
)  O
,  O
Grilled  O
Tasmanian  O
Salmon  O
Fillet  O
(  O

,  O

)  O
and  O
Australian  O
Lamb  O
Cutlets  O
(  O
$  O
56  O
)  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
something  O
for  O
everyone  O
and  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
about  O
steak  O
.  O

and  O
middle-market  O
restaurants  O
are  O
greatly  O
sought  O
after  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
the  O
organisers  O
that  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
made  O
numerous  O
bookings  O
and  O
no  O
show  O
rate  O
is  O
the  O
highest  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
caused  O
inconvenience  O
to  O
the  O
restaurants  O
and  O
by  O
doing  O
that  O
you  O
may  O
unintentionally  O
took  O
up  O
the  O
seats  O
of  O
your  O
friend  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
courtesy  O
of  O
us  O
to  O
call  O
up  O
the  O
restaurant  O
if  O
we  O
ca  O
n't  O
make  O
it  O
.  O

In  O
doing  O
so  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
can  O
free  O
up  O
the  O
seats  O
for  O
others  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
upcoming  O
event  O
,  O
I  O
understand  O
DiningCity.com  O
will  O
implement  O
some  O
new  O
measures  O
to  O
lower  O
the  O
no  O
show  O
rate  O
.  O

On  O
top  O
of  O
that  O
,  O
they  O
will  O
also  O
update  O
on  O
their  O
twitter  O
account  O
(  O
www.twitter.com/DiningCitySG  O
)  O
whenever  O
seats  O
are  O
freed  O
up  O
from  O

.  O

Noodlestar  O

The  O

Dumpling  O
4.5/5  O
More  O
does  O
not  O
always  O
mean  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
tried  O
Xiao  O

that  O
was  O
overly  O
chunky  O
with  O

thus  O
losing  O
that  O

in  O

and  O
flavours  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
pleasantly  O
surprised  O
that  O

rather  O
delicate  O

did  O
not  O
really  O
work  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
get  O
me  O
wrong  O
,  O
individually  O
the  O
dumpling  O
and  O
sauce  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
greatly  O
have  O
them  O
separately  O
but  O
they  O
are  O
just  O
not  O
compatible  O
with  O

The  O

Dumpling  O
(  O

comes  O
in  O
4  O
colourful  O

They  O
were  O

Although  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
rather  O
mild  O
what  O
stood  O
out  O
was  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
.  O

After  O
trying  O
3  O
of  O
their  O
dumpling  O
dishes  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
thin  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
definitely  O
won  O
my  O
heart  O
.  O

very  O
unique  O
street  O

food  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
before  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
full  O
of  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O

were  O

the  O

Being  O

numerous  O

I  O
still  O

across  O
a  O
restaurant  O
that  O
wok  O
up  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
authentic  O

Eventually  O
I  O
stopped  O
ordering  O
the  O
dish  O
outside  O
Thailand  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
take  O
back  O
my  O
words  O
after  O

tried  O

with  O

We  O
like  O
the  O
spiciness  O

the  O

was  O
indeed  O

I  O
actually  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
fresh  O
crab  O
and  O
minced  O
pork  O
filling  O
was  O
not  O
really  O
necessary  O

E.Clat  O
Gourmet  O
Canteen  O
is  O
located  O
on  O
the  O
3rd  O
floor  O
of  O
Sultan  O
Link  O
building  O
along  O
Mohamed  O
Sultanroad  O
.  O

E.Clat  O
which  O
means  O
brilliancy  O
ofsuccess  O
is  O
a  O
concept  O
by  O
a  O
groupof  O
property  O
agents  O
to  O
offer  O
fine  O
dining  O
for  O
the  O
masses  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
owner  O
also  O
mentioned  O
that  O
they  O
wanted  O
to  O
serve  O
comfort  O
and  O
fun  O
food  O
.  O

That  O
got  O
me  O
confused  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
seating  O
capacity  O
for  O
110  O
pax  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
cooking  O
studio  O
which  O
they  O
plan  O
tohold  O
cooking  O
classes  O
in  O
the  O
near  O
future  O
.  O

Tomato  O
Bruschetta2/5  O
The  O
Tomato  O
Bruschetta  O
(  O
$  O
6.90  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
looked  O
rather  O
pretty  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
let  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
stale  O
home  O
made  O
foccacia  O
.  O

E.Clat  O
Cheesy  O
Onion  O
Fries  O
2.5/5  O
I  O
wastold  O
that  O
the  O
Cheesy  O
Onion  O
Fries  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
creation  O
by  O
the  O
boss  O
himself  O
.  O

The  O
cheeses  O
used  O
were  O
a  O
combination  O
of  O
mozzarella  O
and  O
cheddar  O
.  O

Iwas  O
getting  O
concerned  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
relate  O
fine  O
dining  O
,  O
comfort  O
and  O
fun  O
food  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
only  O
word  O
flashing  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
was  O
messy  O
.  O

Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
4/5  O
The  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
among  O
all  O
the  O
dishes  O
for  O
the  O
tasting  O
session  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
and  O
crisp  O
batter  O
around  O
the  O
succulent  O
and  O
fish  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
breaded  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
beer  O
battered  O
version  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
2.5/5  O
The  O
rice  O
for  O
the  O
Seafood  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
in  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
was  O
rather  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
tangy  O
tomato  O
flavour  O
was  O
not  O
distinct  O
or  O
rather  O
missing  O
from  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

It  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
if  O
the  O
kitchen  O
has  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
cheese  O
,  O
cause  O
I  O
would  O
love  O
to  O
see  O
more  O
in  O
my  O
baked  O
rice  O
.  O

Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
Pasta  O
3/5  O
The  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
Pasta  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
E.Clat  O
most  O
popular  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
well  O
marinated  O
and  O
tender  O
but  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
needs  O
more  O
kick  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Egg  O
Benedict  O
3/5  O
My  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O
yolk  O
of  O
the  O
poached  O
egg  O
oozing  O
out  O
when  O
cut  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
watered  O
down  O
and  O
I  O
disliked  O
the  O
stale  O
home  O
made  O
foccacia  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Duck  O
Pizza  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Smoked  O
Duck  O
Pizza  O
(  O
$  O
18.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crisp  O
crust  O
.  O

The  O
truffle  O
mayonnaise  O
was  O
interesting  O
butthe  O
way  O
it  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
pizza  O
,  O
I  O
had  O
trouble  O
figuring  O
how  O
best  O
to  O
consume  O
it  O
toget  O
an  O
even  O
spread  O
of  O
the  O
truffle  O
mayonnaise  O
.  O

Patta  O
Cotta  O
3/5  O
As  O
I  O
have  O
mentioned  O
in  O
my  O
previous  O
posts  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
Patta  O

.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
group  O
,  O
the  O
Rum  O
and  O
Raisin  O
Patta  O
Cotta  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
rather  O
average  O
and  O
not  O
memorable  O

with  O
a  O
mug  O
of  O
classic  O
Root  O
Beer  O
Float  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
also  O
ask  O
for  O
Pepsi  O

the  O
Smoked  O
Salmon  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
may  O
not  O
look  O
elegant  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
used  O
of  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
onion  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
black  O
olive  O
,  O
tomato  O
and  O
bread  O
crumbs  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
,  O
a  O
healthy  O
but  O
yet  O
flavourful  O
salad  O
to  O
start  O
with  O
.  O

Tomato  O
and  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
4/5  O
The  O
Tomato  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
and  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
surprising  O
creamy  O
,  O
tasty  O
and  O
robust  O
.  O

Like  O
my  O
dining  O
partner  O
Melissa  O
commented  O
,  O
the  O
soups  O
were  O
much  O
better  O
than  O
a  O
popular  O
family  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
which  O
I  O
ca  O
n't  O
agreed  O
more  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Cajun  O
Fish  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Grilled  O
Cajun  O
Fish  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
salad  O
,  O
fries  O
and  O
lime  O
mayonnaise  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
fish  O
was  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
I  O
wo  O
n't  O
mind  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
gathered  O
my  O
thoughts  O
composing  O
the  O
post  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
the  O
grilled  O
fish  O
was  O
sliced  O
into  O
strips  O
.  O

Visually  O
I  O
think  O
people  O
would  O
expect  O
a  O
whole  O
piece  O
of  O
fish  O
fillet  O
so  O
they  O
do  O
n't  O
feel  O
short  O
changed  O
.  O

Baked  O
Macaroni  O
3/5  O
The  O
Baked  O
Macaroni  O
(  O
$  O
9.50  O
)  O
unfortunately  O
was  O
a  O
let  O
down  O
.  O

Though  O
the  O
macaroni  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
,  O
they  O
were  O
kind  O
of  O
bland  O
.  O

Fresh  O
Sage  O
Sausage  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Freash  O
Sausage  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
came  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
the  O
salty  O
side  O
but  O
if  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
and  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
actually  O
had  O
a  O
good  O
balanced  O
of  O
flavours  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
dish  O
at  O
Canadian  O
Pizza  O
Dine-In  O
Cafe  O
.  O

The  O
Crazy  O
Canadian  O
Stacker  O
(  O

bacon  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
onion  O
rings  O
,  O

and  O

.  O

The  O
huge  O
and  O
juicy  O
burger  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
easy  O
for  O
one  O
with  O
a  O
small  O
appetite  O
.  O

that  O
the  O
Peri  O
Peri  O
Chicken  O
(  O

)  O
may  O
be  O
too  O
hot  O
for  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
quite  O
mild  O
and  O
easily  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O

the  O
Steak  O

(  O

)  O
was  O
worth  O
the  O
penny  O
.  O

The  O
perfectly  O
grilled  O
beef  O
impressed  O
me  O
and  O
well  O
paired  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O

.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O

down  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

The  O
dessert  O
was  O
nothing  O
to  O
shout  O
for  O
but  O
decently  O
good  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
small  O
way  O
I  O
am  O

When  O
our  O

wondering  O
how  O
to  O

submerged  O
inside  O
a  O

The  O

a  O

Maureen  O
and  O
I  O
bought  O

The  O
fried  O

was  O
big  O
and  O
fat  O
so  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyable  O
biting  O
into  O
the  O
meaty  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
saltiness  O
of  O
the  O
white  O
bait  O
is  O
the  O
perfect  O
reason  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
wash  O
it  O
down  O
with  O
more  O

Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pans  O
to  O
play  O
with..oh  O
I  O
meant  O
cooked  O
with  O
.  O

Since  O
my  O
family  O
will  O
be  O
glued  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
TV  O
to  O
watch  O
the  O
National  O
Day  O
parade  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
make  O
some  O
pop  O
corns  O
for  O
the  O
family  O
to  O
snack  O
while  O
watching  O
the  O
parade  O
.  O

The  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
Saute-pan  O
is  O
perfect  O
for  O
making  O
the  O
pop  O
corns  O
.  O

With  O
its  O
transparent  O
glass  O
lid  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
easily  O
judge  O
the  O
cooking  O
temperature  O
for  O
the  O
kernel  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
helps  O
to  O
contain  O
the  O
pop  O
corns  O
inside  O
the  O
pan  O
and  O
not  O
popping  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
kitchen  O
's  O
stove  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
seeing  O
the  O
kernels  O
popping  O
and  O
dancing  O
inside  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
Saute-pan  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
now  O
make  O
pop  O
corns  O
at  O
home  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

I  O
should  O
try  O
to  O
make  O
more  O
flavours  O
of  O
pop  O
cornsnext  O
time  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
took  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
cook  O
a  O
simple  O
dinner  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
,  O
giving  O
my  O
mum  O
a  O
well  O
desired  O
break  O
.  O

The  O
Thermo-spot  O
pad  O
of  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
is  O
pretty  O
cool  O
.  O

I  O
usually  O
will  O
test  O
whether  O
the  O
pan  O
is  O
hot  O
enough  O
for  O
cooking  O
by  O
sprinkling  O
some  O
water  O
droplets  O
.  O

Now  O
with  O
the  O
Thermo-spot  O
,  O
once  O
the  O
pan  O
reached  O
the  O
optimal  O
temperature  O
of  O
180  O
Degree  O
Celsius  O
for  O
cooking  O
,  O
the  O
thermo-spot  O
will  O
become  O
solid  O
red  O
.  O

Check  O
out  O
how  O
evenly  O
and  O
beautifullythe  O
Fermented  O
Beancurd  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
turned  O
out  O
.  O

I  O
followed  O
the  O
recipes  O
from  O
WokkingMum  O
.  O

The  O
anti-warping  O
base  O
of  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
ensures  O
homogeneous  O
heat  O
diffusion  O
for  O
optimum  O
cooking  O
,  O
lowering  O
or  O
even  O
no  O
more  O
risk  O
of  O
overheating  O
and  O
burning  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
dish  O
I  O
cooked  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
was  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Omelette  O
.  O

Cooking  O
an  O
egg  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
tricky  O
.  O

If  O
the  O
pan  O
is  O
not  O
hot  O
enough  O
,  O
the  O
egg  O
will  O
stick  O
to  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

If  O
it  O
is  O
too  O
hot  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
get  O
burnt  O
easily  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
and  O
its  O
non  O
stick  O
coating  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprise  O
that  O
I  O
managed  O
to  O
fry  O
a  O
beautiful  O
vermicelli  O
omelette  O
rather  O
effortless  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
you  O
hate  O
it  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
cooking  O
you  O
still  O
need  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
washing  O
up  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
exactly  O
why  O
I  O
love  O
using  O
non  O
stick  O
pan  O
as  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
washed  O
easily  O
.  O

I  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
soak  O
it  O
with  O
warm  O
soapy  O
water  O
,  O
used  O
an  O
non  O
abrasive  O
washing  O
sponge  O
or  O
dishcloth  O
to  O
clean  O
the  O
surface  O
and  O
rinse  O
it  O
with  O
water  O
.  O

One  O
distinct  O
different  O
I  O

check  O
out  O
their  O
new  O
seafood  O
menu  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Platter  O
4/5  O
We  O
started  O
off  O
with  O
the  O
Seafood  O
Platter  O
(  O
$  O
28++  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
came  O
with  O
an  O
assortment  O
of  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
,  O
calamari  O
rings  O
,  O
battered  O
sea  O
bass  O
fillet  O
,  O
soft  O
shell  O
crab  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
french  O
fries  O
with  O
tartar  O
sauce  O
.  O

Fresh  O
fried  O
seafood  O
with  O
tartar  O
sauce  O
would  O
never  O
go  O
wrong  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
the  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
will  O
a  O
little  O
under  O
cooked  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
4/5  O
The  O
Crispy  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
(  O
$  O
26++  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
pesto  O
sauce  O
,  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
sea  O
bass  O
was  O
beautifully  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
skin  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
pesto  O
sauce  O
pairing  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferthe  O
sauce  O
to  O
bemore  O
zesty  O
though  O
.  O

Chilli  O
Crab  O
Spaghetti  O
4/5  O
I  O
was  O
actually  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
Spaghetti  O
(  O
$  O
26++  O
)  O
.  O

Having  O
tried  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
sauce  O
at  O
Hard  O
Rock  O
Cafe  O
,  O
I  O
knew  O
it  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
fresh  O
crab  O
meats  O
and  O
the  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
coating  O
the  O
spaghetti  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
could  O
substitute  O
the  O
2  O
pieces  O
of  O
toasted  O
bread  O
for  O
a  O
crab  O
claw  O
or  O
maybe  O
some  O
fried  O
soft  O
shell  O
crabs  O
,  O
visually  O
it  O
will  O
look  O
more  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Crab  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O
Last  O
but  O
not  O
least  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Crab  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
20++  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
wok  O
fried  O
withsucculent  O
crab  O
meat  O
,  O
prawns  O
and  O
diced  O
portobello  O
mushroom  O
,  O
wrappedin  O
an  O
egg  O
omelette  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
very  O
tasty  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

Probably  O
my  O
favourite  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
4  O
new  O
seafood  O
dishes  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
taste  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

Overall  O
the  O
new  O
seafood  O
menu  O
at  O
Hard  O
Rock  O
Cafe  O
definitely  O
passed  O
the  O
mark  O
but  O
the  O
pricing  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
challenging  O
.  O

A  O
great  O
thanks  O
to  O
Natalie  O
for  O
having  O
us  O
and  O
Andy  O
for  O
coordinating  O
the  O

If  O
you  O
have  O
been  O
following  O
my  O
blog  O
,  O
you  O
would  O
probably  O
know  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
down  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
market  O
&  O
food  O
centre  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
stalls  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
planning  O
for  O
a  O
hawker  O
trail  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
market  O
&  O
food  O
centre  O
.  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
trips  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
cafe  O
culture  O
that  O
is  O
booming  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
either  O
Forty  O
Hands  O
or  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Bakery  O
but  O
both  O
places  O
were  O
full  O
.  O

Disappointment  O
was  O
short  O
lived  O
when  O
I  O
turned  O
the  O
corner  O
onto  O
Tiong  O
Road  O
and  O
found  O
Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Blackberry  O
Almond  O
Tart  O

Many  O
reviews  O
have  O
mentioned  O
about  O
the  O
tarts  O
at  O
Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Since  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
and  O
Iwere  O
still  O
quite  O
full  O
from  O
lunch  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
a  O
slice  O
of  O
Blackberry  O
Almond  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
to  O
share  O
.  O

The  O
crumbly  O
pastry  O
base  O
was  O
really  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

The  O
fruity  O
topping  O
,  O
almond  O
cream  O
and  O
pastry  O
base  O
were  O
layered  O
in  O
a  O
nice  O
textural  O
balanced  O
proportion  O
.  O

What  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
is  O
the  O
seedy  O
bites  O
we  O
can  O
find  O
in  O
the  O
blackberry  O
toppings  O

With  O
that  O
many  O
cafes  O
setting  O
up  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
area  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
name  O
``  O
Little  O
Melbourne  O
''  O
is  O
rather  O
appropriate  O
for  O
the  O
buzz  O
in  O
the  O

.  O

I  O
love  O
my  O
coffee  O
and  O
drink  O
like  O
3-4  O
cups  O
a  O
day  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
admit  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
differentiate  O

Jacob  O
floated  O
the  O
idea  O
with  O
Maureen  O
,  O
Shiting  O
and  O
me  O
that  O
we  O
should  O
do  O
a  O
monthly  O
dinner  O
thingy  O
todine  O
atrestaurant  O
that  O
we  O
want  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
.  O

After  O
throwing  O
a  O
few  O
suggestions  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Le  O
Bistrot  O
du  O
Sommelier  O
that  O
has  O
moved  O
from  O
its  O
previous  O
location  O
at  O

their  O
new  O
home  O

Braised  O

Jacob  O
and  O
Shiting  O
both  O
had  O
the  O
Braised  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
stuffed  O
with  O
veal  O
sweetbreads  O
served  O
with  O
steamed  O
vegetables  O
and  O
mash  O
potatoes  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
and  O
presentation  O
was  O
rather  O
intimidating  O
to  O
finish  O
.  O

Not  O
to  O
forget  O
the  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O
stuffed  O
veal  O
sweetbreads  O
unless  O
you  O
have  O
an  O
enormous  O
and  O
adventurous  O
appetite  O
.  O

For  O
myself  O
I  O
have  O
the  O
Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
was  O
rather  O
huge  O
again  O
consider  O
this  O
is  O
french  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
lovely  O
fork  O
tender  O
meat  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
easy  O
and  O
made  O
my  O
palate  O
sang  O
to  O
the  O
lovely  O
tunes  O
of  O
flavours  O
.  O

Braised  O
French  O
Chicken  O
Leg  O
4.2/5  O
My  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Braised  O
French  O
Chicken  O
Leg  O
(  O
$  O
28  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
interesting  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
claypot  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
leg  O
was  O
braised  O
in  O
vinegar  O
and  O
tomatoes  O
served  O
with  O
gratin  O
of  O
potatoes  O
at  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Ignoring  O
the  O
presentation  O
,  O
the  O
tangy  O
broth  O
was  O
rather  O
appertizing  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

has  O
the  O
French  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
28  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
piece  O
for  O
taste  O
and  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
aromatic  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
beetroot  O
salad  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
flavour  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
balance  O
for  O
the  O
gamey  O
duck  O
.  O

The  O

(  O

simply  O
brought  O
smiles  O
to  O
our  O
faces  O
with  O
each  O
scoop  O
.  O

The  O
warm  O
chocolate  O

The  O
Green  O

(  O

was  O
a  O

We  O
loved  O
the  O
refreshing  O
sorbet  O
with  O
the  O
green  O
apple  O
bites  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
heavy  O
on  O

After  O
hearing  O
about  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
's  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
ice  O
cream  O
from  O
Charlene  O
,  O
Jacob  O
,  O
Celes  O
and  O
me  O
made  O
our  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
parlour  O
at  O
Shaw  O
Leisure  O
Gallery  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

The  O
homemade  O
ice  O
cream  O
parlour  O
has  O
been  O
scooping  O
ice  O
cream  O
since  O
September  O
2005  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
quite  O
surprise  O
that  O
they  O
were  O
around  O
even  O
before  O
popular  O
ice  O
cream  O
parlour  O
such  O
as  O
Udders  O
,  O
Ice  O

.  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Chocolate  O
4/5  O
Celes  O
had  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
medium  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
ice  O
cream  O
definitely  O
did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
tasteand  O
grainy  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
resembles  O
those  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
one  O
can  O
find  O
in  O
mooncakes  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
noticed  O
that  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
melted  O
very  O
quickly  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
up  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
's  O
website  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
they  O
do  O
not  O
add  O
stabilisers  O
in  O
their  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
as  O
natural  O
as  O
it  O
can  O
get  O
for  O
their  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

Although  O
stabilisers  O
are  O
extracted  O
from  O
natural  O
sources  O
such  O
as  O
seaweed  O
and  O
algae  O
and  O
added  O
to  O
ice  O
cream  O
to  O
slow  O
down  O
the  O
melting  O
process  O
,  O
the  O
source  O
is  O
natural  O
but  O
the  O
extraction  O
method  O
is  O
man  O
made  O
.  O

Salted  O

I  O
tired  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Quattro  O
(  O

4  O
medium  O
)  O
.  O

Quattro  O
was  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
July  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
made  O
with  O
sangria  O
,  O
pineapple  O
,  O
raisin  O
and  O
orange  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
very  O
interesting  O
taste  O
for  O
ice  O
cream  O
and  O
the  O
closest  O
similarity  O
will  O
be  O
Japanese  O
sake  O
,  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O

Classic  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Classic  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
16.50  O
)  O
was  O
made  O
using  O
chicken  O
and  O
veal  O
broth  O
with  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
accompanied  O
by  O
cheese  O
toasts  O
made  O
from  O
Antoinette  O
's  O
signature  O
24-hour  O
baguette  O
.  O

Traditionally  O
the  O
soup  O
is  O
covered  O
with  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
cheese  O
and  O
broiled  O
to  O
brown  O
before  O
serving  O
.  O

At  O
Antoinette  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
substituted  O
with  O
a  O
cheese  O
crust  O
cover  O
made  O
from  O
combo  O
of  O
parmesan  O
and  O
gruyere  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
richness  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
had  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
tangy  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyablethat  O
paired  O
wellwith  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
.  O

Nicoise  O
4/5  O
The  O
Tartine  O
de  O
Nicoise  O
(  O
$  O
26.00  O
)  O
was  O
crowned  O
by  O
a  O
bed  O
ofbutter  O
lettuce  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
,  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
olives  O
,  O
a  O
three-minute  O
egg  O
,  O
anchovy  O
and  O
seared  O

star  O
was  O
the  O
levain  O
bread  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
proprietary  O
yeast  O
starter  O
and  O
takes  O
18  O
days  O
to  O
make  O
.  O

The  O
bread  O
was  O
soft  O
and  O
fluffy  O
with  O
a  O
tangy  O
flavour  O
amid  O
a  O
hard  O
crispy  O
crust  O

The  O
Confit  O

Poitrine  O
de  O
Porc  O
(  O
$  O
36  O
)  O
or  O
simply  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Confit  O
was  O
cured  O
in  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
sea  O
salt  O
,  O
brown  O
sugar  O
and  O
aromatics  O
,  O
and  O
then  O
cooked  O
,  O
covered  O
in  O
duck  O
fat  O
for  O
90  O
degrees  O
Celsius  O
over  O
12  O
hours  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
thecrackling  O
skin  O
was  O
abit  O
darker  O
in  O
colour  O
which  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
if  O
it  O
was  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
brown  O
sugar  O
during  O
the  O
curing  O
process.The  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
garlic  O
mash  O
,  O
seasonal  O
vegetables  O
,  O
and  O
mustard  O
sauce  O
.  O

Bouchees  O
aux  O
fruits  O
de  O
mer  O
3.5/5  O
My  O
first  O
impression  O
of  O
theBouchees  O
aux  O
fruits  O
de  O
mer  O
(  O
$  O
30  O
)  O
resembles  O
the  O
chinese  O
yam  O
basket  O
.  O

The  O
puff  O
pastry  O
case  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
luxurious  O
seafood  O
medley  O
of  O
scallops  O
,  O
prawns  O
,  O
squid  O
and  O
mussels  O
sauteed  O
with  O
white  O
wine  O
and  O
cream  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
quite  O
impressed  O
that  O
the  O
pastry  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
considering  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
layers  O
involved  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
ingredients  O
did  O
n't  O
come  O
together  O
as  O
one  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
complex  O
or  O
difficult  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
seafood  O
and  O
pastry  O
as  O
a  O
whole  O
.  O

I  O
wouldgladly  O
havethe  O
seafood  O
and  O
pastry  O
separately  O

Prawn  O
Crumble  O
Pasta  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
Prawn  O
Crumble  O
Pasta  O
(  O
$  O
26  O
)  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

First  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
parsley  O
pesto  O
to  O
the  O
more  O
common  O
basil  O
pesto  O
.  O

Next  O
was  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
homemade  O
anchovy  O
crumble  O
that  O
was  O
sprinkled  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
pasta  O
.  O

Iwas  O
quite  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
pasta  O
that  O
had  O
both  O
textures  O
and  O
flavours  O
working  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

Besides  O
a  O
wide  O
repertoireof  O
savoury  O
items  O
,  O
Le  O
Jardin  O

also  O
has  O
a  O
exquisite  O
selection  O
of  O
desserts  O
that  O
Antoinette  O
is  O
well  O
known  O
for  O
amid  O
its  O
luxuriant  O
setting  O
.  O

After  O
a  O
hearty  O
meal  O
,  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
try  O

collection  O
of  O

I  O
do  O
not  O
really  O
have  O
a  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
and  O
the  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

with  O

Best  O
to  O
enjoy  O
with  O

wash  O
down  O
the  O
sweetness  O
.  O

Tarte  O
Exotique  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Tarte  O
Exotique  O
(  O
$  O
8.50  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
desserts  O
among  O
thefour  O
we  O
tried  O
.  O

A  O
luscious  O
gula  O
melaka  O

.  O

The  O
technique  O
and  O
used  O
of  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
in  O
the  O
subtle  O
dessert  O
just  O
demonstrate  O
the  O
chef  O
's  O
talent  O
and  O
prowess  O
in  O
his  O
forte  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
rather  O
new  O
to  O
me  O
and  O
took  O
a  O

When  O
I  O
received  O

,  O
I  O
jumped  O
to  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
since  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
dined  O
at  O
Shangri-La  O
's  O
Rasa  O
Sentosa  O
Resort  O
.  O

Gone  O
were  O
the  O
days  O
where  O
the  O
restaurant  O
were  O
at  O
the  O
different  O
floors  O
of  O
the  O
property  O

After  O
the  O

a  O

under  O
one  O
roof  O
at  O

The  O

was  O
to  O
introduceSilver  O
Shell  O
Cafe  O

Every  O
Wednesday  O

time  O
,  O
diners  O
can  O
indulge  O
themselves  O
in  O
an  O
array  O
of  O
meat  O
selections  O
and  O
cooking  O
styles  O
.  O

Pork  O
Knuckles  O
and  O
Sausages  O
A  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
just  O
behind  O
the  O
reception  O
is  O
dedicated  O
for  O
the  O
amazing  O
display  O
of  O
the  O
meats  O
.  O

A  O
hugh  O
selection  O
ranging  O
from  O
pork  O
knuckes  O
,  O
sausages  O
,  O
lamb  O
rack  O
,  O
beef  O
tenderloin  O
,  O
duck  O
confit  O
,  O
roast  O
chicken  O
,  O
roast  O
tomhawk  O
veal  O
and  O
many  O
more  O
.  O

Roast  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Corns  O
All  O
the  O
roasts  O
,  O
rosemary  O
and  O
the  O
orange  O
lighting  O
just  O
gave  O
me  O
a  O
very  O
Christmas  O
feelin  O
the  O
whole  O
setup  O
.  O

Roast  O
Tomahawk  O
Veal  O
The  O
huge  O
Roast  O
Tomahawk  O
Veal  O
was  O
the  O
most  O
eyes  O
catching  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
and  O
I  O
simply  O
could  O
n't  O
resist  O
having  O
a  O
slice  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
all  O
the  O
lovely  O
and  O
beautiful  O
cuts  O
of  O
the  O
meats  O
from  O
the  O
various  O
Meet  O
the  O
Meat  O
selections  O
.  O

My  O
personal  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
sausages  O
,  O
beef  O
tenderloin  O
and  O
duck  O
confit  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
knucles  O
and  O
lamb  O
were  O
good  O
too  O
...  O
oh  O
my  O
god  O
,  O
I  O
just  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
stomach  O
to  O
eat  O
them  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
buffet  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
about  O
meat  O
.  O

Just  O
like  O
any  O
other  O
buffet  O
spread  O
,  O
there  O
were  O
salads  O
,  O
cold  O
cuts  O
,  O
appertisers  O
,  O
cooked  O
food  O
,  O
local  O
fare  O
and  O
desserts  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
is  O
a  O
MUST  O
TRY  O
here  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
broth  O
was  O
robust  O
with  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavour  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
,  O
a  O
decent  O
selection  O
of  O
desserts  O
are  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
too  O
.  O

Worth  O

the  O
buffet  O

at  O
Silver  O
Shell  O
Cafe  O
has  O
a  O
section  O
specially  O
children  O

Both  O
the  O

on  O
a  O
comfortable  O
height  O
for  O
the  O

Even  O

For  O

the  O

4.2/5  O
The  O
Assorted  O
Seafood  O
in  O
imu  O
style  O
barbeque  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
spicy  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
garlic  O
and  O
sambal  O
.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
robust  O
seafood  O

The  O

cooked  O
by  O

Normally  O

you  O
will  O
end  O
up  O
with  O

The  O

was  O
more  O

it  O

The  O

reggiano  O
lifted  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O

The  O

the  O

out  O

While  O
the  O

felt  O
that  O
the  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O

sour  O
,  O
I  O
actually  O
liked  O
that  O
mild  O

.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
the  O

to  O
be  O
more  O
rich  O
and  O
buttery  O

dipping  O
the  O

the  O

I  O

help  O
to  O
associate  O
it  O

The  O

only  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
yam  O
coated  O
with  O
rich  O
salted  O

sauce  O
was  O
so  O
addictive  O

The  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yam  O
Chips  O
(  O
$  O
9.80  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
firmer  O
texture  O
compared  O
to  O
using  O

.  O

It  O
gave  O
that  O
shiok  O
crackling  O

sound  O
with  O
each  O

into  O
it  O
.  O

The  O

crab  O
came  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
fried  O
shallots  O
and  O
some  O
curry  O

.  O

It  O
has  O
an  O
unique  O
spicy  O

salty  O
combination  O
which  O
was  O
good  O
but  O
not  O
fantastic  O

This  O

a  O

the  O

This  O
is  O
Irvin  O
's  O
specialty  O
with  O
Chef  O
Yap  O
's  O
special  O
recipe  O
.  O

I  O
liked  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
curry  O
leaves  O
are  O
added  O
to  O
give  O
the  O
sauce  O
the  O
extra  O
kick  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
crab  O
was  O
basically  O
swimming  O
in  O
the  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
is  O
so  O
well  O
received  O
by  O
the  O
customers  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
selling  O
it  O
at  O
$  O
12  O
per  O
box  O
,  O
freshly  O
made  O
upon  O

Maybe  O
I  O
should  O
get  O
a  O
box  O
for  O
my  O
nacho  O

The  O

to  O
ask  O
the  O

The  O
fresh  O

was  O
cooked  O
in  O

The  O

Claypot  O
Pumpkin  O
Prawns  O
4/5  O
Our  O
palates  O
were  O
kind  O
of  O
tired  O
and  O
confused  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
and  O
butter  O
sauce  O
dishes  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Claypot  O
Pumpkin  O
Prawns  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
22.80  O
large  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
reconfirm  O
with  O
the  O
kitchen  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
not  O
used  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
instead  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
except  O
that  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
smoother  O
.  O

Same  O
technique  O
of  O
using  O
chilli  O
padi  O
and  O
curry  O
leaves  O
to  O
lift  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
colour  O
looked  O
exactly  O
the  O
same  O
.  O

The  O
pumpkin  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
but  O
I  O
really  O
could  O
not  O
taste  O
the  O
distinct  O
pumpkin  O
flavour  O
.  O

Salted  O
French  O
Beans  O
4/5  O
Finally  O
some  O

after  O
all  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
Salted  O
French  O
Beans  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
15.80  O
large  O
)  O
still  O
had  O
the  O
crunchiness  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
chilli  O
padi  O
,  O
dried  O
shrimps  O
and  O
fried  O
shallots  O
completed  O
the  O
flavours  O
making  O
it  O
a  O
light  O
and  O
delectable  O
dish  O
.  O

As  O

from  O
the  O

,  O
these  O
gigantic  O
food  O
items  O
whichwe  O

Oysters  O
4.5/5  O
Usually  O
when  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
buffet  O
,  O
I  O
will  O
start  O
with  O
the  O
cold  O
section  O
and  O
I  O
definitely  O
will  O
have  O
the  O
oysters  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
will  O
not  O
have  O
more  O
than  O
3  O
so  O
that  O
I  O
leave  O
space  O
for  O
the  O
other  O
buffet  O
spread  O
down  O
the  O
line  O
.  O

I  O
broke  O
the  O
rule  O
at  O
The  O
Square  O
and  O
went  O
back  O
for  O
another  O
4-5  O
serving  O
of  O
their  O
oysters  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
cold  O
section  O
is  O
not  O
big  O
but  O
their  O
oysters  O
were  O
very  O
fresh  O
,  O
big  O
and  O
full  O
.  O

Cooked  O
Salmon  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
lovely  O
cooked  O
Salmon  O
was  O
huge  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
,  O
moist  O
and  O
creamy  O
.  O

A  O
wide  O
variety  O
of  O
cooked  O
food  O
indulging  O
you  O
to  O
various  O
international  O
flavours  O
and  O
cuisines  O
are  O
available  O
at  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
.  O

Cheese  O
Risotto  O
4.5/5  O
I  O
felt  O
very  O
privileged  O
to  O
have  O
Chef  O
Jean-Philippe  O
cooking  O
personally  O
for  O
us  O
the  O
risotto  O
and  O
poached  O
cod  O
fish  O
.  O

The  O
risottowas  O
first  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
pan  O
,  O
transferred  O
andtossed  O
in  O
the  O
huge  O
parmasen  O
cheese  O
wheel  O
to  O
have  O
an  O
even  O
coating  O
of  O
cheese  O
on  O
each  O
grain  O
.  O

Simply  O
love  O
the  O
intense  O
and  O
rich  O
cheesy  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
Cheese  O
Risotto  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
was  O
not  O
mushy  O
or  O
under  O
cooked  O
,  O
still  O
having  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Laksa  O
Risotto  O
4/5  O
Chef  O
Jean  O
Philippe  O
cooked  O
us  O
2  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Laksa  O
Risotto  O
.  O

One  O
with  O
cheese  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
without  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
mixed  O
preference  O
and  O
I  O
preferred  O
the  O
one  O
without  O
cheese  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
the  O
cheese  O
confused  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
laksa  O
which  O
was  O
the  O
core  O
and  O
uniqueness  O
of  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Poached  O
Cod  O
Fillet  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
Poached  O
Cod  O
Fillet  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
is  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
cod  O
fillet  O
was  O
poached  O
in  O
spicy  O
coconut  O
and  O
prawn  O
broth  O
,  O
served  O
with  O
sauteed  O
vegetables  O
and  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
liked  O
the  O
thick  O
and  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
which  O
had  O
a  O
nce  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
,  O
making  O
it  O
very  O
addictive  O
.  O

Laksa  O
3.8/5  O
Like  O
all  O
hotel  O
buffet  O
line  O
,  O
thereare  O
also  O
live  O
stations  O
and  O
local  O
fares  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
laksa  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
made  O
a  O
point  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Laksa  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
missed  O
its  O
mark  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
lacked  O
both  O
the  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavours  O
and  O
rich  O
coconut  O
cream  O
.  O

Most  O
people  O
would  O
leave  O
the  O
dessert  O
to  O
the  O
last  O
so  O
as  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
meal  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
the  O
same  O
for  O
me  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
Sqaure  O
does  O
offer  O
a  O
good  O
spread  O
of  O
delectable  O
desserts  O
.  O

Do  O
try  O
the  O
Durian  O
Pengat  O
and  O
Lemon  O
custard  O
in  O
chocolate  O
cup  O
tart  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
my  O
favourite  O
among  O
all  O
the  O
desserts  O
.  O

The  O
last  O
time  O
I  O
visit  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Market  O
&  O
Food  O
Centre  O
was  O
probably  O
more  O
than  O
5  O
years  O
ago  O
.  O

My  O
memory  O
of  O
Tiong  O
BahruFood  O
Centre  O
was  O
bad  O
air  O
circulation  O
,  O
small  O
and  O
crowded  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
has  O
since  O
undergone  O
renovationand  O
now  O
it  O
is  O
more  O
spacious  O
with  O
good  O
air  O
circulation  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
many  O
reviews  O
on  O
Lor  O
Mee  O

.  O

Since  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
the  O
stall  O
's  O
lor  O
mee  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
to  O
find  O
out  O
why  O
so  O
many  O
people  O
queued  O
up  O
for  O
their  O
lor  O
mee  O
.  O

3.8/5  O
Thewinner  O
for  O
the  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
(  O
$  O
2.50  O
)  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
shark  O
nuggets  O
.  O

The  O
shark  O
meat  O
was  O
surprisely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
the  O
crispy  O
fritter  O
.  O

Different  O
from  O
other  O
stalls  O
,  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
lor  O
mee  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
usual  O
braised  O
egg  O
,  O
braised  O
pork  O
and  O
ngor  O
hiang  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
found  O
the  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
gravy  O
lacked  O
robutness  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
ask  O

My  O
mother  O
reads  O
the  O
Wanbao  O
(  O
)  O
newspaper  O
and  O
I  O
like  O
to  O
browse  O
through  O
the  O
paper  O
's  O
food  O
column  O
.  O

It  O
always  O
introduced  O
local  O
fare  O
and  O
I  O
will  O
make  O
a  O
note  O
to  O
visit  O
them  O
if  O
I  O
came  O
across  O
an  O
interesting  O
stall  O
.  O

Recently  O
Anchor  O
Beer  O
has  O
a  O
contest  O
in  O
Wanbao  O
(  O
)  O
newspaper  O
nominated  O
by  O
their  O
readers  O
for  O
the  O
top  O
5  O
favourite  O
braised  O
duck  O
.  O

Seng  O
Kee  O
's  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
5  O
finalist  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
address  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
passing  O
by  O
this  O
stall  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
8  O
years  O
in  O
my  O
journey  O
home  O
from  O
work  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
there  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
belongs  O
Shiting  O
's  O
uncle  O
,  O
a  O
foodie  O
friend  O
of  O
mine.After  O
firing  O
a  O
few  O
text  O
messages  O
,  O
we  O
met  O
up  O
for  O
a  O
Sunday  O
lunch  O
with  O
Celes  O
and  O
Shiting  O
's  O
family  O
.  O

Braised  O
Duck  O
4.2/5  O
Since  O
Seng  O
Kee  O
was  O
the  O
top  O
5  O
finalist  O
for  O
their  O
braised  O
duck  O
,  O
definitely  O
we  O
must  O
taste  O
it  O
to  O
know  O
why  O
.  O

With  O
over  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
braising  O
experience  O
,  O
no  O
wonder  O
the  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
tradition  O
,  O
similar  O
to  O
how  O
my  O
grandma  O
would  O
have  O
done  O
it  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
around  O
.  O

Not  O
overly  O
intense  O
in  O
flavours  O
,  O
just  O
simple  O
and  O
light  O
but  O
tasty  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
duck  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
fat  O
with  O
just  O
a  O
slight  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
underneath  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
there  O
for  O
just  O
a  O
simple  O
lunch  O
,  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
duck  O
rice  O
will  O
cost  O
$  O
3  O
while  O
the  O
boneless  O
duck  O
rice  O
is  O
$  O
3.50  O
.  O

Assorted  O
Braised  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
stall  O
also  O
sells  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
assorted  O
braised  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Assorted  O
Braised  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
that  O
came  O
with  O
Tau  O
Kwa  O
(  O
$  O
0.80/pc  O
)  O
,  O
Tau  O
Pok  O
(  O

,  O

)  O
and  O
Braised  O
Pig  O
Head  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
minimum  O
)  O
.  O

Not  O
many  O
stall  O
sells  O
braised  O
pig  O
head  O
nowadays.I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture  O
and  O
well  O
braised  O
flavour  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Roast  O
Duck  O
4.5  O
The  O
braised  O
duck  O
was  O
already  O
good  O
but  O
I  O
like  O
Seng  O
Kee  O
's  O
Roast  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
even  O
more  O
.  O

Once  O
again  O
the  O
duck  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
fat  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crisp  O
of  O
skin  O
over  O
thesucculent  O
and  O
tender  O
duck  O
meat  O
.  O

Same  O
as  O
the  O
braised  O
duck  O
.  O

a  O
plate  O
roast  O
duck  O
rice  O
is  O
$  O
3  O
and  O
boneless  O
is  O
$  O
3.50  O
.  O

Roast  O
Pork  O
&  O
Char  O
Siew  O
4/5  O
The  O
Roast  O
Pork  O
and  O
Char  O
Siew  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
are  O
the  O
other  O
roasted  O
meat  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

I  O
loved  O
the  O
roast  O
pork  O
with  O
the  O
crackling  O
crisp  O
skin  O
and  O
the  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
meat  O
and  O
fats  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
used  O
lean  O
meat  O
for  O
the  O
Char  O
Siew  O
after  O
feedback  O
from  O
their  O
customers  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferred  O
it  O

For  O
over  O

painstakingly  O
by  O

using  O
a  O

down  O

in  O

The  O

a  O

pressed  O
it  O

full  O
bodied  O
and  O
robustly  O
flavoured  O
.  O

The  O
perfectly  O
done  O
half  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
here  O
are  O
made  O
from  O
kampung  O
chicken  O
eggs  O
.  O

The  O
eggs  O
have  O
a  O
heavier  O
texture  O
and  O
more  O
distinct  O
aroma  O
of  O
fresh  O
eggs  O
.  O

This  O
Hainanese  O
kopitiam  O
is  O
packed  O
the  O
whole  O
day  O
with  O
customers  O
of  O
all  O
races  O
and  O
from  O
all  O
walks  O
of  O
life  O
.  O

I  O
havent  O
tried  O
their  O
toast  O
buns  O
and  O
breads  O
myself  O
but  O
I  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
very  O
popular  O
.  O

Many  O
people  O
also  O
order  O
their  O
mee  O
siam  O
here  O
.  O

Business  O
can  O
get  O
very  O
hectic  O
here  O
and  O
the  O
harried  O
staff  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
edge  O
.  O

A  O
short  O
walk  O
away  O
is  O
Ah  O
Hua  O
kway  O
teow  O
soup  O
.  O

This  O
old  O
shop  O
has  O
been  O
here  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
and  O
is  O
today  O
run  O
by  O
the  O
third  O
generation  O
.  O

They  O
still  O
use  O
charcoal  O
to  O
boil  O
the  O
soup  O
stock  O
something  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
anywhere  O
else  O
.  O

RM16  O
gets  O
you  O
the  O
Kings  O
version  O
loaded  O
with  O
abalone  O
,  O
fresh  O
oysters  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
extra  O
luxuries  O
.  O

Personally  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
perfectly  O
happy  O
with  O
the  O
basic  O
RM5  O
version  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
old  O
traditional  O
flavours  O
of  O
Teochew  O
kway  O
teow  O
soup  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
like  O
Western  O
,  O
I  O
suggest  O
you  O
try  O
IT  O
Roo  O
cafe  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
another  O
very  O
old  O
Hainanese  O
caf  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
famed  O
for  O
their  O
chicken  O
chops  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
chop  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O
big  O
slab  O
of  O
thigh  O
,  O
crispy  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
and  O
juicy  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
chop  O
comes  O
with  O
their  O
addictive  O
fresh  O
mushroom  O
sauce  O
.  O

Be  O
early  O
as  O
IT  O
Roo  O
is  O
always  O
packed  O
during  O
lunch  O
and  O
you  O
may  O
have  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
your  O
seat  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
same  O
area  O
is  O
Hiap  O
Joo  O
bakery  O
.  O

This  O
traditional  O
bakery  O
still  O
uses  O
their  O
old  O
wood  O
fired  O
oven  O
to  O
bake  O
their  O
cakes  O
and  O
pastries  O
.  O

Hiap  O
Joos  O
banana  O
cake  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
.  O

Go  O
inside  O
the  O
shop  O
and  O
you  O
will  O
see  O
the  O
huge  O
charcoal  O
oven  O
,  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
like  O
combs  O
of  O
bananas  O
used  O
to  O
make  O
the  O
cakes  O
.  O

No  O
artificial  O
flavouring  O
is  O
used  O
here  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
difference  O
,  O
instantly  O
.  O

I  O
always  O
bring  O
home  O
something  O
from  O
Hiap  O
Joo  O
whenever  O
I  O
pass  O
by  O
this  O
shop  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
stay  O
beyond  O
5:00pm  O
,  O
try  O
this  O
BBQ  O
chicken  O
stall  O
in  O
Meldrum  O
Walk  O
.  O

Medrum  O
Walk  O
is  O
a  O
back  O
lane  O
food  O
paradise  O
something  O
we  O
can  O
not  O
find  O
anywhere  O
in  O
Singapore  O
anymore  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
many  O
good  O
food  O
stalls  O
here  O
and  O
my  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
BBQ  O
chicken  O
stall  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
charcoal  O
roasted  O
chicken  O
literally  O
drips  O
with  O
sweet  O
natural  O
juices  O
.  O

The  O
juice  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
,  O
I  O
actually  O
felt  O
bad  O
that  O
some  O
of  O
it  O
inevitably  O
dripped  O
onto  O
the  O
plate  O
when  O
I  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
such  O
a  O
waste  O
J  O
There  O
are  O
many  O
other  O
good  O
food  O
stalls  O
and  O
shops  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
when  O
you  O
are  O
in  O
JB  O
.  O

JB  O
is  O
generally  O
safe  O
but  O
please  O
do  O
be  O
alert  O
and  O
take  O
the  O
usual  O
precautions  O
e.g  O
.  O

move  O
away  O
when  O
approached  O
by  O
Scratch  O
and  O
Win  O
scammers  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
easy  O
to  O
enjoy  O
JB  O
food  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
knowledge  O
of  O
where  O
the  O
good  O
eating  O
places  O
are  O
J  O
.  O

Wish  O
you  O
happy  O
eating  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
myVillage  O
mall  O
dining  O
voucher  O
to  O
spend  O
before  O
it  O
expired.After  O
looking  O
through  O
the  O
list  O
of  O
restaurants  O
in  O
the  O
mall  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Relish  O
with  O
my  O
partner  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
afternoon  O
.  O

Relish  O
is  O
a  O
restaurant  O
under  O
the  O
Wild  O
Rocket  O
Group  O
andowned  O
by  O
Chef  O
Willin  O
known  O
for  O
his  O
Asian-western  O
fusion  O
creation  O
.  O

Mocha  O
and  O
Coconut  O
&  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
Milkshake  O
4.2/5  O
We  O
started  O
with  O
drinks  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Coconut  O
&  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
Milkshake  O
(  O
$  O
8.00  O
)  O
as  O
I  O
never  O
had  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

The  O
name  O
itself  O
also  O
aroused  O
my  O
interest  O
.  O

The  O
interesting  O
combination  O
of  O
flavours  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
which  O
I  O
can  O
distinctly  O
identified  O
the  O
individual  O
core  O
flavours  O
.  O

Sarawak  O
Shepherds  O
Pie  O
4.2/5  O
My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Sarawak  O
Shepherds  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
16.80  O
)  O
that  O
has  O
curry  O
chicken  O
inside  O
the  O
bed  O
of  O
mashed  O
potato  O
.  O

We  O
all  O
know  O
and  O
loveourAsian  O
curry  O
and  O
potato  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
the  O
chef  O
has  O
infusedthem  O
into  O
a  O
western  O
dish  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
harmony  O
with  O
the  O
ingredients  O
and  O
flavours  O
,  O
not  O
stealling  O
the  O
show  O
from  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

We  O
really  O
applauded  O
the  O
creation  O
and  O
we  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
love  O
to  O
have  O
it  O
again  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

Wild  O
Rocket  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
110g  O
4/5  O
Relish  O
is  O
known  O
for  O
its  O
burgers  O
before  O
it  O
introduced  O
other  O
hearty  O
mains  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Going  O
back  O
to  O
what  O
they  O
are  O
popular  O
for  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
Wild  O
Rocket  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
110g  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
burger  O
came  O
with  O
sun-dried  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
rockets  O
and  O
Sarawak  O
pepper  O
cream  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
just  O
the  O
right  O
size  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
handled  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
patty  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
looked  O
overcooked  O
and  O
dry  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
wronged  O
.  O

Biting  O
it  O
into  O
,  O
the  O
juiciness  O
started  O
oozing  O
out  O
from  O
the  O
patty  O
and  O
dripping  O
onto  O
my  O
hand  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
way  O
the  O
restaruant  O
charges  O
for  O
any  O
add  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
burger  O
.  O

The  O
sunny  O
side  O
up  O
cost  O
me  O
an  O
additioal  O
$  O
1.80  O
which  O
I  O
probably  O
can  O
buya  O
dozen  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

new  O
level  O
.  O

Before  O
my  O
visit  O
to  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
I  O
only  O
know  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
Swiss  O
Roll  O
and  O
Sugar  O
Roll  O
from  O
Polar  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Now  O
the  O
conventional  O
rolls  O
have  O
been  O
injected  O
with  O
more  O
flavours  O
and  O
creativity  O
.  O

Thecottony  O
softsponge  O
rolled  O
up  O
with  O
fresh  O
cream  O
and  O
chunk  O
of  O
fruits  O
or  O
nuts  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
were  O
distinctly  O
flavourful  O
and  O
not  O
overly  O
sweet  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
looking  O
for  O
something  O
unique  O
,  O
try  O
the  O
Strawberry  O
Mango  O
Pudding  O
Fruit  O
Roll  O
.  O

Who  O
would  O
have  O
imagine  O
you  O
can  O
have  O
both  O
fruit  O
and  O
pudding  O
inside  O
a  O
sponge  O
roll  O
.  O

Grape  O
Cheese  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Grape  O
Cheese  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
2.20  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
sponge  O
base  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
jellyand  O
grapes  O
.  O

The  O
cheese  O
cake  O
was  O
rather  O
different  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
taste  O
very  O
cheesy  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
different.It  O
was  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
mousse  O
cake  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
4/5  O
If  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
your  O
Tiramisu  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
strong  O
on  O
the  O
liquor  O
or  O
too  O
heavy  O
on  O
the  O
coffee  O
flavour  O
,  O
you  O
will  O
probably  O
like  O
the  O
Tiramisu  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
at  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
intense  O
flavours  O
which  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
easy  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Sheperd  O
Pie  O
4/5  O
The  O
Sheperd  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
2.80  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
delectable  O
chicken  O
chunks  O
,  O
carrots  O
,  O
celery  O
,  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
onions  O
topped  O
with  O
creamy  O
mash  O
potato  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
one  O
I  O
had  O
is  O
the  O
regular  O
size  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
in  O
petite  O
size  O
and  O
party  O
portion  O
for  O
6-8  O
pax  O
.  O

Fruit/Chocolate  O
Tart  O

Another  O
popular  O

at  O

is  O

picture  O
are  O
Blueberry  O
Cheese  O
,  O

,  O

The  O
winner  O
for  O
me  O
is  O

I  O

Anyway  O
,  O
cut  O
the  O
story  O
short  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Hougang  O

looking  O
for  O
lunch  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O

very  O

The  O

impressed  O
me  O
most  O
.  O

Xin  O

The  O
headache  O
about  O
eating  O
at  O
food  O
court  O
is  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
so  O
many  O
choices  O
.  O

After  O
I  O
have  O
recce  O

I  O
find  O

I  O
like  O
to  O
add  O
a  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
invited  O
by  O
Fan  O
Play  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
their  O
Chee  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
asking  O
myself  O
will  O
I  O
be  O
full  O
?  O

What  O
is  O
so  O
special  O
about  O
it  O
?  O

Is  O
there  O
a  O
post  O
angle  O
for  O
my  O
readers  O
?  O

I  O
guess  O
you  O
probably  O
have  O
the  O
same  O
questions  O
in  O
your  O
head  O
now  O
.  O

Well  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
was  O
totally  O
wrong  O
about  O
it.Glad  O
thatI  O
went  O
down  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
proudly  O
share  O
this  O
post  O
with  O
you  O
.  O

Fan  O
Play  O
is  O
actually  O
located  O
inside  O
Carrefour  O
at  O
the  O
Deli  O
section  O
on  O
level  O

.  O

The  O
short  O
cutis  O
to  O
cut  O

the  O
cashier  O
counters  O
,  O
turn  O
right  O
and  O
walk  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
end  O
.  O

Patrons  O
can  O
actually  O
take  O
away  O
or  O
dine  O
inside  O

There  O
is  O
a  O

Beer  O
Battered  O
Dory  O
with  O
Brown  O
Sauce  O
4.5/5  O
Robert  O
the  O
owner  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
the  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
is  O
specially  O
imported  O
from  O
Ipoh  O
twice  O
weekly  O
which  O
the  O
historic  O
town  O
is  O
famous  O
for  O
.  O

He  O
tried  O
manufacturing  O
it  O
in  O
Singapore  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
.  O

He  O
said  O
the  O
water  O
used  O
in  O
Ipoh  O
is  O
different  O
and  O
hence  O
the  O
difference  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
authentic  O
Ipoh  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
,  O
Fan  O
Play  O
also  O
introduces  O
savory  O
gravies  O
atop  O
thesilky  O
smooth  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Dory  O
with  O
Brown  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
my  O
first  O
thoughtwas  O
this  O
is  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
not  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
.  O

Robert  O
explained  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
indeed  O
authentic  O
Ipoh  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
rice  O
flour  O
and  O
water  O
only  O
.  O

I  O
mentioned  O
earlier  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
sceptical  O
whether  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
full  O
since  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
is  O
usually  O
eaten  O
as  O
a  O
snack  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
serving  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
a  O
full  O
meal  O
!  O
.  O

The  O
beer  O
battered  O
dory  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
in  O
the  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
special  O
brown  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
was  O
lightfor  O
the  O
palatethat  O
just  O
married  O
the  O
cheong  O
fan  O
perfectly  O
.  O

for  O

.  O

You  O
may  O
think  O
this  O
is  O
crazy  O
but  O
surprisingly  O
it  O
matched  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
cheong  O
fan  O
.  O

The  O
Chicken  O
Cutlet  O
with  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
is  O
like  O
have  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
curry  O
katsu  O
don  O
except  O
substituting  O
the  O
rice  O
with  O
cheong  O

.  O

If  O
you  O
love  O
curry  O
,  O
this  O
will  O
be  O
for  O
you  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
how  O
the  O

me  O

left  O
my  O

I  O
was  O
challenged  O
to  O
taste  O
a  O
special  O
ingredientsin  O
the  O
sauce  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O

it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O

and  O
Fried  O
Wanton  O
.  O

They  O
are  O
all  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
choose  O
one  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
fish  O
&  O
pork  O
meat  O
wrapped  O
in  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
as  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

I  O
shared  O
with  O
the  O
chef  O
that  O
the  O
Laksa  O
gravy  O
was  O
very  O
nice  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
distinct  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavours  O
.  O

In  O
simple  O
word  O
,  O
it  O
simply  O
taste  O
like  O
laksa  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
that  O
cheong  O
fan  O
felt  O
separated  O
as  O
it  O
didn'tabsorb  O
the  O
gravy  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
was  O
very  O
receptive  O
and  O
even  O
suggestedserving  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O
with  O
more  O
laksa  O
gravy  O
andtweaking  O
the  O
texture  O
by  O
having  O
the  O
cheong  O
fan  O
in  O
smaller  O
pieces  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
them  O
refining  O
the  O
dish.If  O
they  O
can  O
get  O
the  O
formulae  O
right  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
hit  O
with  O
the  O
local  O
.  O

Sar  O
Kok  O
Liew  O
(  O
Stuffed  O
Yambean  O
)  O
4.2/5  O
This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
with  O
the  O
famous  O
Ipoh  O
Sar  O
Kok  O
Liew  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Stuffed  O
Yambean  O
(  O
$  O
0.50/pc  O
)  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
chef  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
very  O
labour  O
intensive  O
and  O
availability  O
is  O
subjected  O
to  O
his  O
mood  O
.  O

Many  O
layers  O
of  O
textures  O
await  O
you  O
as  O
you  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
crisp  O
from  O
the  O
outer  O
layer  O
,  O
the  O
chewy  O
texture  O
that  O
felt  O
like  O
eating  O
nian  O
gao  O
and  O
the  O
crunchy  O
juicy  O
chopped  O
bitesof  O
the  O
stuffed  O
yambean  O
was  O
something  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
that  O
one  O
is  O
never  O
enough  O
.  O

Organic  O
Soya  O
Bean  O
Drink  O
4.2/5  O
If  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
your  O
soya  O
bean  O
drink  O
too  O
sweet  O
,  O
then  O
I  O
think  O
the  O
Organic  O
Soya  O
Bean  O
Drink  O
(  O
$  O
1.50  O
)  O
at  O
Fan  O
Play  O
will  O
probably  O
suit  O
your  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

The  O
drink  O
had  O
astronger  O
soya  O
bean  O
flavour  O
compared  O
to  O
most  O
which  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
and  O
preferred  O
.  O

In  O
my  O
own  O
opinion  O
,  O
it  O
tasted  O
more  O
natural  O
.  O

Current  O
Fan  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
at  O
The  O

because  O
eating  O
salad  O
is  O
never  O
boring  O
again  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
have  O
my  O
choice  O
of  O

that  O
satisfied  O
the  O
carnivore  O
in  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O

is  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
a  O

that  O
guaranteed  O
to  O

not  O

I  O
went  O
for  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

I  O
was  O

It  O

2  O

ordered  O
the  O
Grilled  O

Buttered  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprised  O
how  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tender  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
won  O
me  O
over  O
.  O

The  O
buttered  O
seared  O
pacific  O
dory  O
was  O
as  O
good  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
buttery  O
flavour  O
over  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
fish  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
herby  O
parsley  O
flavour  O
was  O
simply  O
heavenly  O
.  O

Is  O
the  O
grill  O
and  O
salad  O
really  O
that  O
good  O
?  O

Well  O
,  O
it  O
definitely  O
has  O
a  O
place  O
in  O
my  O
heart  O
and  O
I  O
actually  O
went  O
back  O

The  O

I  O
would  O

to  O

,  O
the  O

(  O

was  O
lovely  O
with  O

fresh  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
it  O
came  O
with  O

married  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O

the  O

(  O

from  O

The  O

Soda  O

I  O
call  O
this  O
the  O
modern  O
version  O
of  O
Bandung  O

.  O

The  O
traditional  O
version  O
usually  O
turns  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
way  O
too  O
sweet  O
but  O
the  O
soda  O

has  O
a  O
nice  O
refreshing  O

Buah  O
Belinjau  O
Chips  O
3.8/5  O
While  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Buah  O
Belinjau  O
Chips  O
.  O

Belinjau  O
is  O
a  O
fruit  O
that  O
has  O
medical  O
value  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
read  O
on  O
the  O
web  O
,  O
it  O
helps  O
to  O
reduce  O
sugar  O
level  O
in  O
the  O
blood  O
and  O
helps  O
protect  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

Compare  O
to  O
other  O
chips  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
rather  O
healthy  O
snack  O
as  O
no  O
flour  O
,  O
preservatives  O
or  O
colouring  O
is  O
added  O
.  O

The  O
buah  O
belinjau  O
chips  O
has  O
a  O
subtle  O
bitter  O
taste  O
which  O
surprisingly  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O

The  O

(  O

is  O
a  O
hearty  O
chicken  O
broth  O
with  O

,  O
beansprouts  O
and  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
Potato  O
Croquette  O

For  O
me  O
,  O
the  O
highlight  O
was  O
the  O
potato  O
croquette  O
.  O

The  O
potato  O
croquette  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
theouter  O
crustand  O
fluffy  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
tasty  O
but  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
awkard  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
Soto  O

as  O
a  O

the  O

was  O
looking  O

The  O

were  O
fried  O
until  O
crispy  O
and  O
served  O
with  O

I  O

probably  O
the  O
only  O
one  O
that  O
kept  O
going  O

for  O
more  O

palatable  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
meat  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
the  O
gravy  O
should  O
be  O
that  O
watery  O
but  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
thicker  O

actually  O
preferred  O

Located  O
along  O
East  O
Coast  O
Road  O
at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
East  O
Coast  O
Road  O
and  O
Chapel  O
Road  O
,  O
is  O
this  O
nostalgia  O
old  O
school  O
confectionery  O
with  O
mosaic  O
floor  O
tiles  O
and  O
marbled  O
top  O
tables  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
has  O
limited  O
seating  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
rather  O
hot  O
and  O
stuffy  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
2nd  O
visit  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
morning  O
and  O
the  O
place  O
is  O
always  O
packed  O
with  O
breakfast  O
crowd  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
first  O
timer  O
,  O
ordering  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
confusing  O
.  O

The  O
couple  O
of  O
waiting  O
staffs  O
are  O
so  O
busy  O
that  O
itis  O
rather  O
hard  O
to  O
catch  O
their  O
attention  O
.  O

The  O
tip  O
is  O
to  O
just  O
look  O
for  O
a  O
sitting  O
area  O
,  O
sit  O
down  O
and  O
self  O
service  O
the  O
pastries  O
at  O
the  O
display  O
cabinets  O
.  O

When  O
you  O
manage  O
to  O
catch  O
the  O
attention  O
of  O
the  O
waiting  O
staff  O
,  O
order  O
your  O
drinks  O
and  O
kaya  O
buns.Upon  O
your  O
drinks  O
and  O

are  O
served  O
,  O
tell  O
the  O
waiting  O
staff  O
what  O
pastries  O
you  O
have  O
taken  O
and  O
he/she  O
will  O
write  O
it  O
down  O
in  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
white  O
paper  O
for  O
you  O
to  O
pay  O
at  O
the  O
cashier  O
when  O
you  O
are  O
done  O

The  O

After  O
trying  O
out  O
a  O
few  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Doubled  O
Sided  O
Pan  O
recipes  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
challenge  O
myself  O
to  O
cook  O
something  O
more  O
sophisticated  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
make  O
home  O
made  O
Char  O
Siew  O
!  O

So  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
supermarket  O
and  O
bought  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
pork  O
loin  O
.  O

I  O
marinated  O
the  O
pork  O
loin  O
and  O
left  O
it  O
overnight  O
.  O

I  O
realized  O
my  O
char  O
siew  O
did  O
not  O
fully  O
absorb  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

After  O
checking  O
with  O
some  O
kitchen  O
experts  O
,  O
they  O
advised  O
me  O
to  O
poke  O
holes  O
in  O
the  O
meat  O
next  O
time  O
when  O
I  O
want  O
to  O
marinate  O
.  O

The  O
Char  O
Siew  O
was  O
also  O
lacking  O
in  O
sweetness  O
and  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
how  O
on  O
earth  O
I  O
have  O
left  O
out  O
the  O
honey  O
in  O
the  O
recipe  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
finally  O
product  O
of  O
my  O
grilled  O
Char  O
Siew  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
manage  O
to  O
control  O
the  O
fire  O
well  O
and  O
I  O
should  O
have  O
checked  O
the  O
meat  O
more  O
often  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
Char  O
Siew  O
was  O
still  O
very  O
beautiful  O
inside  O
.  O

Hopefully  O
I  O
can  O
perfect  O
it  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
attempt  O
.  O

Every  O
year  O
for  O
my  O
parents  O
birthday  O
,  O
our  O
family  O
will  O
brainstorm  O
for  O
a  O
restaurant  O
to  O
bring  O
the  O
old  O
folks  O
to  O
celebrate  O
their  O
birthday  O
.  O

My  O
mother  O
's  O
birthday  O
falls  O
in  O
May  O
this  O
monthand  O
my  O
youngest  O
sister  O
suggested  O
going  O
for  O
dim  O
sum  O
since  O
the  O
2  O
old  O
folks  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
one  O
.  O

Instantly  O
I  O
suggested  O
Royal  O
Chinaas  O
I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
after  O
reading  O
good  O
reviews  O
of  O
their  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

Steamed  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Chicken  O
Claws  O
(  O

)  O
or  O
some  O
calledit  O
phoenix  O

is  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
for  O
me  O
whenever  O
I  O
go  O
for  O
dim  O

.  O

Some  O
people  O
are  O
disgust  O
with  O
the  O
sight  O
but  O
for  O
me  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
such  O
a  O
delicacy  O
.  O

The  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
gave  O
the  O
chicken  O
claws  O
another  O
lift  O
in  O
flavours  O
which  O
I  O
thought  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
and  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
4.8/5  O
This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
BEST  O
Steamed  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
or  O
Har  O
Gaos  O
,  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

The  O
freshness  O
and  O
crunchiness  O
of  O
the  O
prawn  O
just  O
simply  O
blown  O
me  O
away.I  O
felt  O
like  O
I  O
was  O
just  O
eating  O
the  O
prawn  O
itself  O
without  O
the  O
thin  O
translucent  O
skin  O
wrapped  O
around  O
it  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
see  O
how  O
thin  O
the  O
skin  O
was  O
,  O
it  O
looked  O
like  O
the  O
prawn  O
is  O
trying  O
to  O
break  O
free  O
from  O
it  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Wolfberry  O
4.8/5  O
I  O
have  O
known  O
of  O
friends  O
who  O
do  O
n't  O
eat  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
or  O
Steam  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
portion  O
of  O
minced  O
meat  O
in  O
it  O
and  O
that  O
porky  O
taste  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
the  O
siew  O
mai  O
was  O
constructed  O
with  O
minced  O
meat  O
sandwiched  O
in  O
between  O
2  O
fresh  O
prawns  O
.  O

The  O
minced  O
meat  O
portionwas  O
lesserand  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
their  O
version  O
as  O
it  O
has  O
more  O
flavours  O
andcontrasting  O
textures  O
.  O

The  O
smooth  O
and  O
silky  O
Seafood  O
Congee  O
(  O
$  O
8.50  O
)  O
will  O
definitely  O
warm  O
your  O
stomach  O
for  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
delicious  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
think  O
that  O
Royal  O
China  O
is  O
very  O
generous  O
with  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
prawns  O
.  O

prawn  O

The  O

The  O
savoury  O

with  O

ingredients  O
beautifully  O
complements  O
the  O

and  O
I  O
just  O
have  O
to  O
give  O
in  O

)  O
with  O
its  O
crisp  O
crackling  O
skin  O
and  O

so  O
beautiful  O
that  O

Teach  O
someone  O
a  O
simple  O

When  O

they  O
will  O
get  O
to  O
experience  O
fresh  O

This  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
simple  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Napa  O
Cabbage  O
that  O
I  O
learnt  O
from  O
Noob  O
Cook  O
.  O

The  O
recipe  O
can  O
be  O
found  O
at  O

The  O
leafy  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
Napa  O
Cabbage  O
is  O
separated  O
from  O
the  O
stems  O
.  O

The  O
stems  O
were  O
then  O
cut  O

pieces  O

For  O
the  O

also  O
prepared  O
some  O
sliced  O

The  O
dried  O
shrimps  O
were  O
not  O
in  O
the  O
original  O
recipe  O
from  O
Noob  O
Cook  O
.  O

I  O
added  O
it  O
because  O
I  O
like  O

extra  O
taste  O

flavours  O
from  O
them  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
sauce  O

it  O

a  O
simple  O
light  O
sauce  O

soy  O

Cooking  O
is  O
simple.Heat  O

pan  O
.  O

Put  O
in  O
the  O
gingers  O
,  O
garlics  O

quite  O
a  O
thoughtful  O

as  O
the  O
juiciness  O
of  O
the  O

The  O

is  O
very  O

Fugu  O
Mirin  O
Boshi  O
4/5  O
When  O
I  O
knew  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
serve  O
me  O
Fugu  O
which  O
is  O
puffer  O
fish  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
anticipating  O
this  O
dish  O
with  O
anxiety  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
puffer  O
fish  O
and  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
deadly  O
if  O
not  O
being  O
prepared  O
properly  O
.  O

Actually  O
Fugu  O
Mirin  O
Boshi  O
(  O
$  O
12++  O
)  O
is  O
very  O
different  O
from  O
what  O
I  O
have  O
imagined  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
dried  O
puffer  O
fish  O
seasoned  O
with  O
sweet  O
sake.It  O
is  O
a  O
traditional  O
snack  O
eaten  O
while  O
drinking  O
sake  O
.  O

While  O
some  O
of  O
us  O
debated  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
Bak  O
Kwa  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
tasted  O
more  O
like  O
dried  O
Cuttlefish  O
.  O

The  O
homemade  O
dressing  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
vinegary  O
taste  O
married  O
the  O
dish  O
perfectly  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
only  O
confused  O
with  O
the  O
idea  O
of  O
smoked  O
duck  O
in  O

.  O

Initiallythe  O
dishtasted  O
salty  O

when  O
it  O
is  O
eaten  O
with  O
the  O
right  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
smooth  O
egg  O

,  O
the  O

was  O
actually  O
quite  O

and  O
light  O
and  O
yet  O
refreshing  O

The  O

was  O

to  O

and  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
special  O
mayonnaise  O

.  O

The  O
beef  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
heavenly  O
and  O
the  O

simply  O
give  O
it  O
a  O

level  O
of  O

a  O

On  O
a  O
fine  O
Friday  O
evening  O
,  O
Maureen  O
and  O
I  O
together  O
with  O

were  O
also  O
given  O
complimentary  O
Quiche  O
which  O
is  O
bursting  O
with  O
flavours  O
.  O

It  O
got  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
excited  O
,  O
looking  O

to  O
our  O

Adam  O
Trio  O
4/5  O
The  O
7  O
Adam  O
Trio  O
(  O
$  O
27  O
)  O
Appetiser  O
consists  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
,  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
and  O
Fresh  O
slices  O
of  O
Tuna  O
Loins  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
of  O
the  O
three  O
is  O
the  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
.  O

Biting  O
into  O
the  O
crispy  O
crab  O
cake  O
,  O
a  O
rush  O
of  O
beautiful  O
flavours  O
hit  O
the  O
taste  O
buds  O
,  O
sending  O
them  O
dancing  O
in  O
delights  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
what  O
is  O
the  O
sauce  O
for  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
,  O
it  O
came  O
to  O
be  O
as  O
something  O
that  O
has  O
caramel  O
sweetness  O
.  O

I  O
found  O
the  O
texture  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
mushy  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
Tuna  O
Loins  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
a  O
shadow  O
to  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
and  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
.  O

I  O
guess  O
the  O
strong  O
flavours  O
from  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
and  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
could  O
have  O
overshadowed  O
it  O

4/5  O
The  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
Cheek  O
(  O
$  O
37  O
)  O
looks  O
rather  O
ordinary  O
sitting  O
on  O
a  O
mash  O
of  O
Yam  O
and  O
Spinach  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
cheeknot  O
only  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
,  O
it  O
melted  O
my  O
heart  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
tender.For  O
the  O
Yam  O
mash  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
potato  O
mash  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
tell  O
the  O
different  O

Baba  O
Pork  O

4/5  O
The  O
Baba  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
(  O

has  O
a  O
sweet  O
caramelized  O
crisp  O
outer  O
layer  O
with  O
tender  O
meat  O
falling  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
.  O

The  O
ribs  O
were  O
well  O
executed  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
the  O
wow  O
factor  O
inwhat  O
the  O
chef  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
show  O
in  O
his  O
cooking  O
.  O

Cod  O

Confit  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Cod  O
fish  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
consists  O
of  O
two  O
huge  O
fillets  O

fish  O
sat  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
pilaf  O
rice  O
with  O
orange  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
cod  O
fish  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
saucing  O
was  O
rather  O
light  O
and  O
the  O
whole  O
dish  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
ordinary  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

Duck  O
Confit  O

The  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
with  O
Szechuan  O
pepper  O
salt  O
(  O

was  O
a  O
big  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
tough  O
and  O
chewy  O
.  O

We  O

2.5/5  O
The  O
Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
looks  O
beautiful  O
but  O
again  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
ws  O
rather  O
simple  O
to  O
be  O
charging  O
$  O
15  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
joking  O
amount  O
ourselves  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
easily  O
put  O
the  O
dish  O
together  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
warn  O
that  O
the  O
tart  O
base  O
is  O
extremely  O
hard  O
and  O
difficult  O
dessert  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
like  O
trying  O
to  O
break  O
the  O
tart  O
.  O

Yes  O
!  O

breaking  O
the  O
tart  O
not  O
cutting  O
the  O
tart  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
pastry  O
has  O
an  O
interesting  O
sweet  O
flavour  O
which  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
thought  O
it  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
water  O
chestnut  O
pastry  O
.  O

In  O
summary  O
formy  O
dinner  O
experience  O
at  O
7Adam  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
give  O
full  O
marks  O
for  O
its  O
ambience  O

Food  O

did  O
have  O
a  O

turned  O
out  O
mediocre  O
and  O
it  O
did  O
n't  O
excite  O
me  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
price  O
tag  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
sure  O
I  O
can  O
find  O
better  O
food  O
elsewhere  O
unless  O
you  O
are  O
willing  O
to  O
pay  O
for  O

I  O
used  O
to  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
seventh  O
month  O
festive  O
at  O
my  O
neighbourhood  O
because  O
when  O
there  O
was  O
Chinese  O
Opera  O
or  O
Getai  O
performance  O
,  O
these  O
mobile  O
hawkers  O
will  O
appear  O
from  O
nowhere  O
to  O
sell  O
local  O
snacks  O
and  O
my  O
all  O
time  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
.  O

Except  O
for  O
the  O
famous  O
Hougang  O
6  O
Mile  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
stall  O
that  O
has  O
moved  O
to  O
Blk  O
69  O
Bedok  O
South  O
,  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
remember  O
knowing  O
anywhere  O
selling  O
them  O
now  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
went  O
onto  O
theweb  O
and  O
found  O
a  O
ready  O
easy  O
to  O
make  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
recipe  O
from  O
Cuisine  O
Paradisein  O
15  O
minutes  O
.  O

Now  O
I  O
can  O
enjoy  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
anytime  O
I  O
want  O
.  O

All  O
the  O
ingredients  O
needed  O
for  O
the  O
dish  O
,  O
Glutinous  O
Flour  O
,  O
Peanut  O
Powder  O
,  O
White  O
Sesame  O
Seeds  O
and  O
Shallot  O
can  O
be  O
easilyfound  O
at  O
any  O
major  O
supermarkets  O
.  O

Frying  O
the  O
sliced  O
shallot  O
to  O
golden  O
brown  O
to  O
get  O
the  O
shallot  O
oil  O
.  O

Once  O
the  O
Flour  O
mixture  O
ispouredinto  O
the  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Pan  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
solidified  O
rather  O
fast  O
.  O

Quickly  O
use  O
a  O
wooden  O
spoon  O
or  O
chopsticks  O
to  O
keep  O
stirring  O
it  O
into  O
a  O
dough  O
.  O

The  O
dough  O
is  O
very  O
sticky  O
sofor  O
easy  O
wash  O
later  O
,  O
do  O
use  O
something  O
wooden  O
.  O

Remember  O
to  O
oil  O
a  O
plate/container  O
before  O
transferring  O
the  O
dough  O
from  O
the  O
pan  O
to  O
the  O
plate/container  O
.  O

If  O
not  O
the  O
dough  O
will  O
stick  O
to  O
the  O
plate/container  O
and  O
hard  O
to  O
remove  O
later  O
.  O

After  O
preparing  O
the  O
sesame  O
and  O
peanut  O
powder  O
,  O
I  O
transferred  O
the  O
dough  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
pan  O
to  O
mix  O
with  O
the  O
peanut  O
mixture  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
caster  O
sugar  O
so  O
I  O
used  O
normal  O
sugar  O
instead  O
.  O

The  O
normal  O
sugar  O
gave  O
the  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
a  O
rough  O
texture  O
.  O

My  O
advice  O
is  O
to  O
skip  O
the  O
sugar  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
have  O
caster  O
sugar  O
.  O

It  O
will  O
still  O
taste  O
as  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
last  O
step  O
is  O
to  O
cut  O
the  O
dough  O
into  O
small  O
pieces  O
,  O
mixed  O
them  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
peanut  O
mixture  O
and  O
you  O
are  O
ready  O
to  O
serve  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
on  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
,  O
the  O
decor  O
and  O
ambient  O
instantly  O
made  O
me  O
felt  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
back  O
in  O
Korea  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
Korean  O
diners  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
seems  O
quite  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
Korean  O
community  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
buffet  O
spread  O
area  O
does  O
not  O
look  O
big  O
but  O
it  O
offers  O
a  O
good  O
variety  O
of  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
cuisines  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
a  O
cooked  O
food  O
section  O
that  O
offers  O
dishes  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
Rice  O
Cake  O
,  O
Korean  O
pancakes  O
and  O
etc  O
...  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
section  O
offering  O
different  O
Korean  O
sides  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
the  O
main  O
MEAT  O
section  O
!  O
!  O
!  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
Beef  O
,  O
Pork  O
,  O
Lamb  O
and  O
even  O
prawns  O
that  O
were  O
available  O
.  O

They  O
have  O
original  O
flavours  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
marinated  O
meats.A  O
staffis  O
stationed  O
at  O
the  O
meat  O
section  O
and  O
whenever  O
the  O
meat  O
is  O
running  O
low  O
,  O
he  O
will  O
quickly  O
topped  O
it  O
up  O
.  O

Many  O
buffet  O
restaurants  O
would  O
sliced  O
their  O
meat  O
into  O
thin  O
strips  O
to  O
cut  O
down  O
on  O
cost  O
but  O
look  O
at  O
those  O
pieces  O
of  O
meat  O
onthe  O
BBQ  O
grill  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
why  O
I  O
have  O
said  O
earlier  O
it  O
is  O
worth  O
paying  O
the  O
amount  O
as  O
the  O
restaurant  O
never  O
cut  O
back  O
on  O
quality  O

the  O
Coca  O

I  O
am  O
sort  O
of  O
addicted  O
to  O
cooking  O
cause  O
cooking  O
seem  O
so  O
easy  O
overnight  O
.  O

After  O
browsing  O
several  O
blog  O
sites  O
and  O
recipes  O
,  O
I  O
decide  O
to  O
tryCuisine  O
Paradise  O
's  O
Claypot  O
Rice  O
recipe  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
all  O
the  O
necessary  O
ingredients  O
as  O
in  O
Cuisine  O
Paradise  O
's  O
recipe  O
hence  O
I  O
make  O
do  O
with  O
what  O
I  O
could  O
find  O
in  O
the  O
fridge  O
.  O

Instead  O
of  O
chicken  O
,  O
I  O
used  O
pork  O
ribs  O
.  O

For  O
vegetables  O
,  O
I  O
used  O
snow  O
peas  O
and  O
Yifon  O
assorted  O
bottled  O
mushrooms  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
madeseveral  O
mistakes  O
in  O
the  O
process  O
such  O
as  O
putting  O
in  O
the  O
vegetables  O
too  O
early  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
picture  O
below  O
,  O
the  O
snow  O
peas  O
have  O
been  O
cooked  O
too  O
long  O
and  O
turned  O
yellow  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
rice  O
turned  O
out  O
quite  O
nice  O
and  O
has  O
similar  O
texture  O
as  O
claypot  O
cooking  O
method  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
the  O
moist  O
but  O
yet  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
texture  O
at  O

What  O
about  O
the  O
food  O
?  O

The  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Seafood  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
7  O
)  O
indeed  O
was  O
very  O
authentic  O
and  O
spicy  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
had  O
outside  O
Thailand  O
.  O

Quantity  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
sacrificed  O
with  O
cheap  O
price  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
amouth  O
of  O

The  O

of  O

Chicken  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
came  O
with  O
nice  O
tender  O
chicken  O
fillet  O
slices  O
.  O

The  O
thick  O
and  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
also  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
that  O
went  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
.  O

Olive  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Olive  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
)  O
was  O
fluffy  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
different  O
from  O
others  O
as  O
the  O
dish  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
walnuts  O
,  O
shredded  O
carrot  O
and  O
shredded  O
mango  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
gave  O
the  O
dish  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
dimension  O
in  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O
.  O

By  O
the  O
way  O
,  O
I  O
forgot  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
photo  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
the  O
leftover  O
after  O
we  O
took  O
our  O
portion  O
.  O

texture  O

If  O

too  O
!  O

I  O
have  O
bought  O
my  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Double  O
Sided  O
Pan  O
from  O
G  O
market  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
and  O
has  O
been  O
looking  O
for  O
a  O
simple  O
recipe  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
cook  O
so  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
challenging  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
try  O
any  O
recipe  O
that  O
involes  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
processes  O
or  O
cutting  O
.  O

I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
Noob  O
Cook  O
Coca  O
Cola  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
recipeand  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
simple  O
andeasy.So  O
over  O
the  O
weekend  O
,  O
the  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Double  O
Sided  O
Pan  O
lost  O
its  O
virginity  O
to  O
a  O
novice  O
cook  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
12  O
mid  O
joint  O
chicken  O
wings  O
marinaded  O
for  O
30  O
minutesin  O
light  O
soy  O
sauce  O
,  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
sesame  O
oil  O
.  O

Noob  O
Cook  O
recipe  O
mentioned  O
to  O
marinade  O
for  O
15  O
minutes  O
but  O
I  O
double  O
it  O
hoping  O
that  O
the  O
meat  O
will  O
be  O
more  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Next  O
I  O
brown  O
the  O
chicken  O
wings  O
on  O
both  O
sides  O
beside  O
pouring  O
the  O
coca  O
cola  O
,  O
water  O
and  O
left  O
over  O
marinade  O
sauce  O
into  O
the  O
pan  O
and  O
let  O
it  O
simmer  O
until  O
it  O
is  O
reduced  O
to  O
a  O
dark  O
sticky  O
syrup  O
.  O

I  O
suspect  O
I  O
used  O
too  O
much  O
of  O
the  O
liquid  O
mixture  O
and  O
it  O
told  O
more  O
than  O
15-20  O
minutes  O
(  O

I  O
tried  O
to  O
look  O
up  O
its  O

not  O

give  O
me  O

was  O
quite  O
an  O
expensive  O
investment  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
I  O
spent  O
$  O
215  O
on  O
it  O
after  O
10  O

card  O
discount  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
love  O
at  O
first  O
sight  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
buy  O
it  O
immediately  O
.  O

I  O
gave  O
myself  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
to  O
look  O
for  O
other  O
cheaper  O
alternatives  O
before  O
going  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
shop  O
toget  O

When  O
I  O
started  O
my  O
blog  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
using  O
my  O
Iphone  O
3GS  O
and  O
compact  O
Canon  O
IXUS  O
120IS  O
digital  O
camera  O
to  O
shoot  O
my  O
photos  O
.  O

It  O
was4  O
monthsago  O
that  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
``  O
go  O
to  O
the  O
dark  O
side  O
''  O
and  O
invested  O
in  O
a  O
DSLR  O
camera  O
.  O

I  O
got  O
myself  O
a  O
basic  O
DSLR  O
camera  O
,  O
the  O
Canon  O
600D  O
with  O
Kit  O
II  O
(  O
EF  O
S18-135IS  O
)  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
afraid  O
to  O
handle  O
the  O
complicated  O
equipment  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
clueless  O
what  O
to  O
do  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
guidance  O
and  O
help  O
from  O
fellow  O
foodies  O
especially  O
Maureen  O
from  O
MissTamChiak  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
more  O
comfortable  O
in  O
handling  O
the  O
equipment  O
.  O

Lately  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
thinking  O
of  O
getting  O
a  O
flash  O
and  O
a  O
macro  O
lens  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
these  O
do  O
not  O
come  O
cheap  O
.  O

I  O
wonder  O
if  O
any  O
Santa  O
Claus  O
out  O
there  O
is  O
reading  O
this  O

is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
greatest  O
inventions  O
of  O
all  O
the  O
time  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
a  O

that  O
keeps  O
me  O
connected  O
at  O
all  O
times  O
beside  O
the  O
normal  O

.  O

My  O
Iphone  O
3GS  O
keeps  O
me  O
connected  O
on  O
social  O

and  O
I  O
am  O
frequently  O
on  O
Twitter  O
,  O
Path  O
,  O

andFoursquare  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
my  O
navigator  O
,  O
helping  O
me  O
to  O
get  O
from  O
one  O
place  O
to  O
another  O
.  O

It  O
doubles  O
up  O
as  O
my  O
notepad  O
too  O
.  O

I  O
used  O
it  O
tonote  O
down  O
my  O
food  O
experience  O
when  O
I  O
visit  O
a  O
restaurant/cafe/stall  O
.  O

Everyone  O
who  O
owns  O
an  O

will  O
know  O

Whenever  O
I  O

I  O
will  O
be  O
out  O
for  O
the  O

,  O
I  O
will  O
bring  O

Who  O
says  O

does  O
not  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
in  O
my  O

.  O

all  O
,  O

do  O

weather  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
extreme  O
and  O
it  O
can  O
get  O
pretty  O

and  O

too  O
.  O

I  O
do  O
perspire  O
quite  O
easily  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
nice  O
to  O
attend  O
a  O

invite  O
when  O
I  O
am  O
soaked  O
in  O

.  O

Hence  O
I  O
usually  O
carry  O
a  O

to  O
clean  O
myself  O
up  O
and  O
a  O

My  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
German  O
Potato  O
Salad  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
chunky  O
potatoes  O
that  O
was  O

The  O
CT  O
's  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
(  O
$  O
10.50  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
dry  O
although  O
the  O
patty  O
was  O
meaty  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

Maybe  O
it  O
was  O
because  O
it  O
was  O
left  O
sitting  O
there  O
for  O
too  O
long  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
photo  O
taking  O
.  O

I  O
wish  O
it  O
could  O
be  O
more  O
messy  O
for  O
some  O
juiciness  O
to  O
it  O
such  O
as  O
an  O
runny  O
egg  O

I  O
still  O
remember  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
with  O
Spice  O
Sutra  O
a  O
few  O
years  O
back  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
good  O
reviews  O
about  O
the  O
restaurant  O
on  O
Hungrygowhere.com  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
decide  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
made  O
a  O
last  O
minute  O
U-turn  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
's  O
doorstep  O
as  O
there  O
were  O
hardly  O
any  O
customers  O
.  O

Thanks  O
to  O
Charlene  O
from  O
www.missuschewy.com  O
asking  O
me  O
along  O
for  O
a  O
food  O
tasting  O
session  O
at  O
Spice  O
Sutra  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
able  O
to  O
judge  O
for  O
myself  O
whether  O
the  O
reviews  O
are  O
truth  O
.  O

Spice  O

serves  O
Northern  O
Indian  O

In  O

The  O

(  O

31.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
an  O
assortment  O
of  O

's  O
selection  O
of  O
meats  O
marinated  O
with  O

A  O
good  O

where  O

offers  O
.  O

Samosa  O

The  O
Samosa  O
Chaat  O
(  O
$  O
5.90  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
best  O
try  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
like  O
an  O
open  O
faced  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Samosa  O
we  O
usually  O
have  O
.  O

It  O

,  O

Do  O
n't  O
be  O
deceived  O
by  O
the  O
greenish  O
sauce  O
,  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
this  O

$  O
3.50  O
)  O
and  O
Garlic  O
Naan  O
(  O

sliced  O
into  O

The  O
Naans  O
were  O
fluffy  O

not  O
oily  O

Butter  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O
To  O
go  O
with  O
the  O

,  O
we  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Butter  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
15.90  O
)  O
so  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
dip  O
it  O
into  O
the  O
gravy  O
and  O
scoop  O
the  O
tender  O
boneless  O
tandoori  O
chicken  O
.  O

Mutton  O

We  O
also  O
ordered  O
the  O
Mutton  O
Masala  O
(  O
$  O
15.90  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

The  O

cubes  O
cooked  O
in  O
spicy  O
gravy  O
was  O
very  O
soft  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Biryani  O
4.5/5  O
The  O
Prawn  O
Biryani  O
(  O
$  O
15.90  O
)  O
was  O
the  O
surprise  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
Basmati  O
rice  O
absorbed  O
the  O
aromatic  O
flavours  O
from  O
the  O
spices  O
and  O
retained  O
themoisture  O
making  O
the  O
rice  O
very  O
fragrant  O
.  O

Spice  O

definitely  O
is  O
a  O
place  O
where  O
spices  O
and  O
taste  O
matters  O
most  O
.  O

4/5  O
After  O

,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
try  O
the  O

on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
warm  O
dessert  O
with  O
sweeten  O
carrot  O
strips  O
.  O

The  O
taste  O
and  O
texture  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
to  O
me  O
,  O
kind  O
of  O
like  O
eating  O
fruit  O

range  O
of  O

A  O
wide  O
range  O
of  O
savoury  O
and  O
sweet  O
(  O
dessert  O
)  O
thin  O
crust  O
pizzas  O
,  O
fresh  O
salads  O
,  O
hearty  O
main  O
courses  O
,  O
pastas  O
and  O
appetizers  O
are  O
available  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
which  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O
12-inch  O
record  O
.  O

12-inch  O
Pizzas  O
has  O
both  O
an  O
indoor  O
andalfrescodining  O
area  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
the  O
outdoor  O
area  O
with  O
it  O
spacious  O
sitting  O
and  O
view  O
.  O

Cheese  O
Fries  O
4/5  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
firm  O
and  O
slightly  O
crispy  O
deep  O
fried  O
straight  O
cut  O
fries  O
topped  O
with  O
melted  O
orange  O
cheddar  O
cheese  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
melted  O
cheese  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
light  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
cheesy  O
.  O

Buffalo  O
Wings  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
thought  O
Buffalo  O
Wings  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
hot  O
and  O
spicy  O
but  O
the  O
mid  O
joint  O
wings  O
were  O
on  O
the  O
sweet  O
side  O
,  O
deep  O
fried  O
and  O
glazed  O
with  O
BBQ  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
buffalo  O
wings  O
came  O
with  O
celery  O
and  O
blue  O
cheese  O
dressing  O
just  O
like  O
how  O
it  O
was  O
traditionally  O
served  O
.  O

Black  O
Pepper  O
Crab  O
4/5  O
When  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Crab  O
Pizza  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
will  O
come  O
out  O
something  O
on  O
the  O
black  O
colored  O
side  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
wrong  O
as  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photo  O
.  O

The  O
pizza  O
has  O
crab  O
claw  O
meats  O
,  O
shredded  O
crab  O
sticks  O
,  O
sliced  O
onions  O
in  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
cheese  O
spread  O
on  O
a  O
thin  O
crust  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
diced  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
chopped  O
cilantro  O
.  O

Interesting  O
concept  O
but  O
it  O
lacks  O
the  O
distinct  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
black  O
pepper  O
.  O

Roasted  O
Duck  O
with  O
Hoisin  O
sauce  O
4/5  O
Another  O
interesting  O
pizza  O
we  O
had  O
was  O
the  O
Roasted  O
Duck  O
with  O
Hoisin  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
pizza  O
has  O
sliced  O
roasted  O
duck  O
,  O
hoisin  O
sauce  O
,  O
shiitake  O
mushroom  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
cheese  O
on  O
a  O
thin  O
crust  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
crispy  O
popiah  O
skin  O
and  O
drizzles  O
of  O
hoisin  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
say  O
it  O
is  O
kind  O
of  O
an  O
acquired  O
taste  O
if  O
you  O
prefer  O
the  O
traditional  O
pizza  O
.  O

The  O
crispy  O
popiah  O
skin  O
and  O
hoisin  O
sauce  O
were  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
pizza  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
appreciate  O
if  O
there  O
were  O
more  O
duck  O
meats  O
though  O
.  O

.  O

Usually  O
we  O
celebrate  O
his  O
birthday  O
at  O
some  O
Chinese  O
restaurants  O
but  O
I  O
suggest  O
a  O
change  O
sincemy  O
parenthas  O

for  O
International  O
Buffet  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
seventh  O
dayof  O
the  O
Lunar  O
New  O
Year  O
which  O
means  O
Renri  O
(  O
)  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
Chinese  O
customs  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
day  O
human  O
beings  O
were  O
created  O
.  O

Celebrating  O
the  O
day  O
vary  O
from  O
place  O
to  O
place  O
.  O

In  O
Singapore  O
,  O
we  O
will  O
have  O
Yusheng  O
(  O
)  O
or  O
Prosperity  O
Toss  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
Lo  O
Hei  O
(  O
)  O
in  O
Cantonese  O
.  O

Yusheng  O
is  O
considered  O
a  O
symbol  O
of  O
abundance  O
,  O
prosperity  O
and  O
vigor  O
as  O
it  O
sounds  O
like  O
(  O
)  O
meaning  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
abundance  O
.  O

The  O
comtemporary  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Yusheng  O
(  O
)  O
is  O
said  O
to  O
be  O
created  O
and  O
popularised  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
usually  O
consists  O
of  O

vegetables  O
and  O
a  O

Last  O
month  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
Johor  O
Bahru  O
for  O
a  O
day  O
trip  O
just  O
torevel  O
in  O

.  O

We  O
took  O

that  O
took  O
us  O

the  O
Singapore  O

.  O

After  O
clearing  O
the  O
immigration  O

custom  O
at  O
Singapore  O

to  O
queue  O
again  O

to  O
bring  O
you  O
to  O
Johor  O
Bahru  O
.  O

Some  O
people  O
may  O
get  O
confuse  O
with  O
the  O
queue  O
but  O
taking  O
either  O
SBS  O
bus  O
160  O
or  O
170  O
from  O
this  O
stage  O
onwards  O
is  O
the  O
same  O
.  O

Just  O
hop  O

will  O
bring  O
you  O

Black  O
Hokkien  O
Mee  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
signature  O
noodle  O
Malaysian  O
dish  O
that  O
every  O
Singaporean  O
would  O
order  O
whenever  O
they  O
visit  O
Malaysia  O
as  O
we  O
hardly  O
find  O
it  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Hokkien  O
Mee  O
here  O
is  O
pretty  O

as  O
it  O
was  O

in  O
a  O

full  O
of  O
pork  O

Last  O
Saturday  O
my  O

I  O
met  O
up  O
with  O
with  O

their  O

Garden  O
Country  O

Sake  O
Tapino  O
4.5/5  O
We  O
were  O
here  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Sake  O

which  O
comes  O
in  O
2  O
sizes  O
at  O
$  O
78  O
(  O

pax  O
)  O
and  O
$  O
156  O
(  O
for  O
6-8  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
ingredients  O
will  O
be  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
pot  O
of  O
solely  O
Sake  O
Soup  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
wrong  O
.  O

Actually  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
uses  O
pork  O
bone  O
soup  O
as  O
it  O
base  O
and  O
a  O
bottle  O
of  O
Sakewas  O
poured  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

We  O
opt  O
for  O
the  O
waitress  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

First  O
serving  O
was  O

Sake  O
flavour  O
soup  O
.  O

the  O
Sake  O
flavour  O
was  O
milder  O
and  O
we  O
had  O
tofu  O

and  O
cabbage  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
udon  O
in  O
soup  O
to  O
wrap  O
up  O
the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
feast  O

.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
was  O
kind  O
enoughfor  O
us  O
to  O
swap  O

the  O
Sake  O
Tapino  O
.  O

Beside  O
the  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
dish  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
finish  O
as  O
the  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

The  O

meat  O
was  O
also  O
tough  O

Teriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
4/5  O
A  O
nice  O
balance  O
of  O
Japanese  O
flavours  O
for  O
theTeriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Sandwich  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
.  O

Maybe  O
it  O
is  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
chicken  O
breast  O
.  O

Tuna  O
with  O
Apple  O
Sandwich  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
Tuna  O
with  O
Apple  O
is  O
very  O
interesting  O
.  O

I  O
asked  O
for  O
the  O
sandwich  O
when  O
I  O
spotted  O
it  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
tuna  O
was  O
done  O
,  O
neither  O
too  O
wet  O
nor  O
dry  O
with  O
too  O
much  O
mayonnaise  O
.  O

The  O
green  O
apple  O
chunks  O
also  O
gave  O
the  O
sandwich  O
a  O
fruity  O
freshness  O
flavour  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
a  O

,  O
you  O
can  O
order  O
the  O

Mushrooms  O
Sandwich  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
order  O
it  O
but  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
small  O
tastingportion  O
of  O
the  O
marinated  O
mushroom  O
.  O

The  O
assorted  O
mushrooms  O
which  O
are  O
imported  O
from  O
Japan  O
were  O
bursting  O
with  O
flavours  O
with  O

2  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
6  O

restaurants  O
at  O
Ramen  O

since  O
there  O
were  O
only  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
me  O
.  O

We  O
took  O
quite  O
awhile  O
to  O
decide  O

eventually  O
settled  O
for  O
Menya  O

Being  O

,  O
the  O
Black  O
Shoyu  O
Ramen  O
from  O
Menya  O
Iroha  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
try  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
have  O
this  O
type  O
of  O
black  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
Negitama  O

came  O
in  O
a  O
clear  O

,  O
leek  O
,  O

,  O

,  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
the  O
black  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
tasted  O
so  O
good  O
!  O

I  O
am  O
definitely  O
won  O
over  O
by  O
it  O
.  O

No  O
wonder  O
it  O
has  O
been  O
consecutive  O
champion  O
in  O
2009  O
and  O
2010  O
.  O

The  O
flavourful  O
broth  O
has  O
a  O
rich  O
soya  O
sauce  O
sweetness  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
sesame  O
aroma  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O

that  O

n't  O
give  O
me  O
a  O
greasy  O

The  O
Elephant  O
Parade  O
is  O
the  O
worlds  O
largest  O
open  O
air  O
art  O
exhibition  O
of  O
decorated  O
elephant  O
statues  O
that  O
seeks  O
to  O
attract  O
public  O
awareness  O
and  O
support  O
for  O
Asian  O
elephant  O
conservation  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Elephant  O
Parade  O
2011  O
came  O
to  O
Singapore  O
back  O
in  O
Novemeber  O
2011  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
to  O
capture  O
all  O
the  O
162  O
life  O
size  O
elephants  O
that  O
are  O
exhibit  O
in  O
various  O
parts  O
of  O
the  O
island  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
past  O
one  O
month  O
plus  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
going  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
taking  O
pictures  O
of  O
these  O
beautiful  O
decorated  O
elephants  O
by  O
international  O
artists  O
and  O
celebrities  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
the  O
rainy  O
season  O
and  O
many  O
times  O
my  O
plan  O
was  O
disrupted  O
or  O
postponed  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
the  O
elephants  O
also  O
started  O
to  O
move  O
around  O
as  O
in  O
not  O
they  O
moved  O
by  O
themselves  O
but  O
transported  O
by  O
forklift  O
to  O
more  O
elephant  O
friendly  O
locations  O
which  O
made  O
it  O
harder  O
to  O
locate  O
them  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
I  O
persisted  O
and  O
finishedthe  O
goal  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
set  O
for  O
myself  O
.  O

Enjoy  O
the  O

Rice  O
3.5/5  O
The  O
Soto  O
Medan  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
beautiful  O
greenish  O
gravy  O
with  O
fresh  O

swimming  O
inside  O

Like  O
the  O
Kari/Curry  O

,  O
I  O
prefer  O
something  O
more  O
thick  O
,  O
heavy  O
and  O
creamy  O
.  O

Pecel  O

3.5/5  O
This  O
is  O
another  O
uniquely  O
Indonesian  O
dish  O
.  O

Pecel  O
which  O
is  O
vegetables  O
in  O

I  O
have  O
mentioned  O
in  O
previous  O
posts  O
that  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
fancy  O
this  O
dish  O
as  O
I  O
personally  O
find  O
the  O
combination  O
weird  O
.  O

Indonesia  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
simple  O
and  O
plain  O
looking  O
Indonesia  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
is  O
defintely  O
the  O
surprise  O
of  O
the  O
day  O
.  O

The  O
fragrant  O
fried  O
rice  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Definitely  O
something  O
I  O
will  O
go  O
back  O
for  O
.  O

The  O
Mi  O
Sop  O
Ayam  O
has  O
a  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
soup  O
that  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
mix  O
of  O
yellow  O

For  O

that  O

it  O

they  O
can  O
add  O
their  O
signature  O
dark  O

.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
does  O
sell  O
the  O
chilli  O
in  O
bottled  O
form  O
but  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
pre-order  O
a  O

The  O
lack  O

Sekoteng  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Sekoteng  O
at  O
Pondok  O
Rasa  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
Chinese  O
dessert  O
Cheng  O
Teng  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
sweet  O
and  O
refreshing  O
with  O
ingredients  O
like  O
corn  O
kernel  O
,  O
dried  O
orange  O
skin  O
and  O
slasih  O
.  O

Likewise  O
,  O

be  O

it  O
was  O

Pisang  O
Bumbu  O
(  O
Banana  O
Fritter  O
&  O
Peanut  O
Sauce  O
)  O
4/5  O
The  O
Pisang  O
Bumbu  O
is  O
the  O
owner  O
's  O
favourite  O
childhood  O
food  O
and  O
the  O
Chef  O
has  O
recreated  O
the  O
dish  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
.  O

The  O
Banana  O
Fritter  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
exactly  O
the  O
way  O
the  O
owner  O
likes  O
to  O
eat  O
it  O
in  O
his  O
childhood  O
days  O
.  O

Is  O
this  O
a  O
dessert  O
dish  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
from  O
the  O
banana  O
and  O
savoury  O
from  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
?  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
fish  O
and  O
chips  O
looks  O
alike  O
banana  O
fritter  O
without  O
the  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
is  O
already  O
a  O
winner  O
.  O

Cold  O
and  O
Hot  O
Kolak  O
Pisang  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
Kolak  O
Pisang  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
local  O
dessert  O
Bo  O
Bo  O
Cha  O
Cha  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
the  O
same  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
sweet  O
cocont  O
soup  O
,  O
tapioca  O
and  O
sweet  O
potato  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
served  O
either  O
cold  O
or  O
hot  O
.  O

The  O
different  O
is  O
corn  O
kernel  O
and  O
banana  O
are  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
Kolak  O

With  O
the  O
major  O
renovation  O
at  O
Chinatown  O
Point  O
,  O
the  O
first  O
Mouth  O
Restaurant  O
which  O
was  O
operating  O
there  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
25  O
years  O
pulled  O
down  O
its  O
shutters  O
on  O
13  O
Oct  O
2011  O
and  O
moved  O
to  O
its  O
new  O

Congee  O
with  O
Pig  O
Intestine  O
3.8/5  O
The  O
Congee  O
with  O
Pig  O
Intestine  O
has  O
an  O
interesting  O
chinese  O
dish  O
name  O
called  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
was  O
smooth  O
and  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
meat  O
balls  O
andfried  O
innards  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
spiciness  O
which  O
was  O
rather  O
interesting  O
but  O
can  O
be  O
subjective  O
to  O
individual  O
's  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Spare  O
Ribs  O
with  O
Pumpkin  O
4/5  O
Spare  O
Ribs  O
with  O
Pumpkin  O
,  O
thedish  O
sounds  O
interesting  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
what  O
sort  O
of  O
uniquecreation  O
or  O
flavours  O
that  O
will  O
excite  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
just  O
having  O
a  O
few  O
slices  O
of  O
pumpkin  O
sitting  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
steamed  O
with  O
the  O
spare  O
ribs  O
together  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
taste  O
any  O
pumpkin  O
flavours  O
anywhere  O
in  O
the  O
dish  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
pumpkin  O
slices  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
spare  O
ribs  O
were  O
nice  O
and  O
meaty  O
.  O

I  O
hate  O
to  O
have  O
those  O
that  O
only  O
have  O
ribs  O
but  O
no  O
meat  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Claws  O
and  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
dim  O
sum  O

for  O
me  O
.  O

Like  O
the  O
sauce  O
and  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
chilli  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
taste  O

Shanghai  O

4/5  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
Shanghai  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
particular  O
if  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
is  O
too  O
thick  O
.  O

The  O
dumpling  O
definitely  O
passed  O
its  O
mark  O
here  O
.  O

to  O
have  O
Fried  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
but  O
the  O
restaurant  O
only  O
served  O
Steam  O
Carrot  O

.  O

The  O
steam  O
versionwas  O
light  O
and  O
in  O
a  O
way  O

with  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O

back  O
into  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
decorated  O
with  O
antique  O
furniture  O
and  O
artifacts  O
everywhere  O
as  O

it  O

the  O

The  O

was  O
simple  O

fresh  O
and  O
nice  O
.  O

The  O

were  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O

the  O
kids  O

they  O
enjoyed  O
it  O

I  O
find  O
the  O

rather  O

Chicken  O

Bumbu  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
Indo  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
not  O
sure  O
why  O
the  O
Sweet  O
Sour  O
Chicken  O
dish  O
is  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
although  O
they  O
substitute  O
pork  O
with  O
chicken  O

it  O
is  O

the  O

favourite  O

Sambal  O
Kangkong  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
think  O
Sambal  O
Kangkong  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
vegetable  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
realized  O
I  O
usually  O
order  O
it  O
when  O
I  O
dine  O
outside  O
.  O

The  O
belacan  O
chilli  O
infused  O
with  O
the  O
kangkong  O
was  O
really  O
shiok  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
not  O
overcooked  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
crunchiness  O
that  O
I  O
like  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappinted  O
with  O
the  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
rubbery  O
which  O
did  O
not  O
justify  O
for  O
the  O
flavourful  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
.  O

Cold  O
Tofu  O

You  O

often  O
get  O
to  O
find  O
Cold  O
Tofu  O
with  O
Preserved  O
Egg  O
served  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
tried  O
this  O
dish  O
in  O
Taiwan  O
and  O
I  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
cold  O
tofu  O
was  O
tasteless  O
but  O
paired  O
withpreserved  O
egg  O
,  O
salted  O
egg  O
and  O

it  O

The  O
Mini  O

all  O

!  O
It  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O

unique  O
combination  O
.  O

The  O
spring  O

was  O
fried  O
perfectly  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
colouring  O
and  O
the  O
skin  O
was  O
very  O
crispy  O
.  O

You  O
may  O

Whenever  O
I  O
am  O
down  O
at  O
Orchard  O
Road  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
have  O
difficulty  O
deciding  O
where  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
lunch/dinner  O
mainly  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
crowd  O
and  O
price  O
.  O

Last  O
weekend  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Orchard  O
Road  O
shopping  O
for  O
Christmas  O
gifts  O
and  O
I  O
happened  O
to  O
walk  O
passed  O
this  O
interesting  O
Hainanese  O
Boneless  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
restaurant  O
on  O
the  O
fifth  O
floor  O
of  O
Far  O
East  O
Plaza  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
rather  O
small  O
with  O
a  O
narrow  O
walkway  O
.  O

Do  O
expect  O
to  O
share  O
tables  O
with  O
others  O
and  O
sitting  O
shoulder  O
to  O
shoulder  O
with  O
other  O
customers  O
.  O

Hainanese  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
restaurant  O
serves  O
both  O
the  O
Boiled  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Roasted  O
Chicken  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Boiled  O
Chicken  O
which  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
jelly  O
like  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
fat  O
compared  O
to  O
some  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
though  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
meat  O
also  O
seems  O
whiter  O
in  O
colour  O
.  O

Not  O
captured  O

I  O

The  O

my  O
advice  O
is  O
not  O
to  O

of  O
Indian  O
curry  O
in  O
the  O
Pork  O
Cutlet  O

The  O
combination  O
of  O

lifted  O
the  O

of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O

was  O

the  O
meat  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O

A  O

the  O

4.5/5  O
For  O
a  O
start  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Dessert  O
Tea  O
whichwas  O
an  O
unique  O
and  O
interesting  O
combination  O
of  O
tea  O
and  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
French  O
Rose  O
Tea  O
with  O
Champagne  O
Vanilla  O
Gelato  O
and  O
Oolong  O
Tea  O
with  O
Lychee  O
Martini  O
Gelato  O
.  O

The  O
Dessert  O
Tea  O
definitely  O
won  O
our  O
hearts  O
with  O
the  O
innovative  O
and  O
refreshing  O
concept  O
.  O

The  O
Dessert  O
Tea  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
small  O
cup  O
of  O
the  O
tea  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
warm  O
touch  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
true  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
freshly  O
brewed  O
tea  O
's  O
quality  O
.  O

The  O
Double  O
Teasery  O
came  O
with  O
6  O
mini  O
bites  O
and  O
cold  O

.  O

On  O
the  O
top  O
plate  O
,  O
there  O
were  O
the  O
Signature  O
Crispy  O
Wraps  O
and  O
Apple  O
Cake  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Wraps  O
with  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
was  O
an  O
unique  O
creation  O
using  O
Roti  O
Prata  O
to  O
wrap  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
your  O
filling  O
.  O

The  O
plain  O
looking  O
Apple  O
Cake  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
moist  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
other  O
Double  O
Teasery  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Crispy  O
Wraps  O
with  O
Roasted  O
Beef  O
and  O
Orange  O
Cake  O
.  O

Both  O
were  O
excellent  O
too  O

Among  O
all  O
,  O
the  O

a  O

The  O

Although  O
the  O

the  O

an  O
unique  O

which  O
tantalize  O

through  O

.  O

For  O
the  O
food  O
tasting  O
session  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
introduced  O
to  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
signature  O
local  O
favourites  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
on  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
Kitchen  O
menu  O
.  O

First  O
up  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
handrolled  O
Popiah  O
filled  O
withrefreshing  O
shredded  O
vegetables  O
,  O
bamboo  O
shoot  O
,  O
minced  O
pork  O
and  O
mushroom  O
,  O
prawn  O
and  O
egg  O
slices.I  O
disliked  O
Popiah  O
that  O
is  O
wet  O
and  O
messy  O
to  O
eat  O
with.Thumbs  O
up  O
to  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
the  O
fresh  O
Popiah  O
skin  O
although  O
thin  O
can  O
be  O
easily  O
picked  O
up  O
without  O
the  O
ingredients  O
falling  O
apart  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
the  O
Popiah  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
with  O
diners  O
.  O

Almost  O
every  O
table  O
ordered  O
it  O
.  O

Popiah  O
4.5/5  O
Next  O
I  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Rojak  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprised  O
that  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
has  O
their  O
own  O
sauce  O
mix  O
for  O
making  O
the  O
Rojak  O
.  O

The  O
Rojak  O
sauce  O
mix  O
was  O
really  O
good  O
!  O

It  O
tasted  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
Rojak  O
stalls  O
oreven  O
better.These  O
stalls  O
can  O
probablyconsider  O
buying  O
the  O
Rojak  O
sauce  O
mix  O
from  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
instead  O
.  O

Rojak  O
4.5/5  O
Hainanese  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
signature  O
dishes  O
at  O
Prima  O
Taste  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

The  O
poached  O
chicken  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
jelly  O
like  O
skin  O
.  O

The  O
chicken-flavoured  O
rice  O
was  O
not  O
oily  O
and  O
very  O
fragrant  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
medley  O
of  O
chilli  O
,  O
ginger  O
and  O
black  O
soya  O
sauces  O
to  O
further  O
enhance  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Hainanese  O

4.2/5  O
Laksa  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
local  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
high  O
expectation  O
when  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Laksa  O
here  O
.  O

The  O
Laksa  O
has  O
a  O
rich  O
and  O
spicy  O
coconut  O
gravy  O
which  O
did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
me  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
rice  O
noodles  O
,  O
prawns  O
,  O
fish  O
cake  O
,  O
cockles  O
and  O
tau  O

.  O

The  O
rice  O
noodles  O
can  O
also  O
be  O
purchased  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
if  O
you  O
intend  O
to  O
cook  O
some  O
Laksa  O
at  O
home  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
good  O
bowl  O
of  O
Prawn  O
Mee  O
it  O
is  O
all  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
soup  O
that  O
makes  O
the  O
different  O
.  O

It  O
must  O
have  O
the  O
prawny  O
taste  O
andflavour  O
fromhours  O
of  O
brewing  O

shells  O
.  O

How  O
did  O
the  O
Prima  O

fare  O
?  O

Excellent  O
!  O

The  O

was  O
really  O
very  O
flavourful  O
with  O
the  O

is  O
also  O
used  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
Fried  O

dish  O
!  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
pretty  O
cool  O
.  O

Getting  O
a  O
pack  O
of  O
Prawn  O

and  O
you  O
can  O
cook  O
two  O
different  O
Singapore  O
local  O
dishes  O
out  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
semi  O
wet  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Fried  O
Hokkien  O
Mee  O
that  O
infused  O
with  O
the  O

Now  O
they  O
can  O
sample  O
both  O
the  O

and  O
purchase  O
the  O

at  O
the  O
same  O

.  O

The  O
Teochew  O

Bak  O

has  O
very  O
tender  O
pork  O
ribs  O
which  O
came  O
of  O
the  O
bone  O
easily  O
.  O

The  O
peppery  O
soup  O
came  O
witha  O
mild  O
herbal  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
balance  O
not  O
overpowering  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

Personally  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
peppery  O
.  O

The  O

Chicken  O
has  O
a  O
rich  O
and  O
creamy  O

.  O

However  O
it  O
lacked  O
the  O
spiciness  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
.  O

Anyway  O
itis  O
just  O
a  O
personally  O
preference.The  O
dish  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
white  O
rice  O
but  O
you  O
can  O
request  O
for  O
the  O
chicken-flavoured  O

.  O

The  O

goes  O
very  O
well  O
with  O

The  O

with  O

in  O

was  O
a  O

but  O
a  O
refreshing  O
dessert  O
after  O
a  O
hot  O
day  O
shopping  O
at  O
Orchard  O

.  O

The  O
Chendol  O
on  O

was  O
a  O
beautiful  O
dessert  O
with  O
its  O
sweet  O
and  O
strong  O
flavours  O
coming  O
from  O
the  O
Gula  O

It  O
would  O
make  O
the  O

smoother  O
if  O
the  O

could  O
be  O
finer  O

neither  O

Last  O
Monday  O
was  O
a  O
public  O
holiday  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
a  O
morning  O
forest  O
walk  O
starting  O
from  O
Henderson  O
Wave  O
,  O
intending  O
to  O
end  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
end  O
at  O
Alexandra  O
Arch  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
the  O
forest  O
walk  O
was  O
under  O
repair  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
turn  O
back  O
for  O
an  O
early  O
lunch  O
.  O

I  O
took  O
a  O
2  O

to  O

Hainanese  O
Curry  O

I  O
am  O
at  O
the  O
vicinity  O
.  O

This  O
place  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
with  O
taxi  O
uncle  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
taxi  O
parked  O
at  O
the  O
carpark  O
behind  O
the  O
coffee  O
shop  O
and  O
taxi  O
uncles  O
sipping  O
coffee  O

Pork  O
Chop  O
4/5  O
Unlike  O
the  O
norm  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
served  O
at  O
other  O
places  O
,  O
the  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
here  O
came  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
pool  O
of  O
gravy  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
the  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
and  O
the  O
gravy  O
just  O
came  O
together  O
as  O
one  O
dish  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
way  O
,  O
it  O
sort  O
of  O
given  O
the  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
a  O
succulent  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O

Curry  O
Squid  O
4/5  O
The  O
Squidserved  O

not  O
spicy  O
.  O

Like  O
all  O
traditional  O
Hainanese  O
dish  O
,  O
the  O
taste  O
is  O
more  O
inclined  O
to  O
the  O
sweet  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
squid  O
was  O
nice  O
and  O
fresh  O
but  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
springy  O
.  O

Stewed  O
Cabbage  O
4.2/5  O
The  O
Stewed  O

me  O
whenever  O
I  O
have  O
Hainanese  O

.  O

While  O
the  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
may  O
have  O
slightly  O
different  O
versions  O
,  O
the  O
Stewed  O
Cabbage  O
has  O
pretty  O
similar  O
preparation  O
styles  O
among  O
the  O

I  O
always  O

flown  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
from  O
Seattle  O
,  O
Marshal  O
asked  O
the  O
kitchen  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
crabs  O
in  O
6  O
different  O
local  O
cooking  O
styles  O
.  O

Crab  O
Bee  O
Hoon  O
The  O
distinct  O
characteristic  O
of  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
is  O
its  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
a  O
firm  O
scallop  O
like  O
texture  O
.  O

This  O
consistency  O
in  O
texturewas  O
found  O
in  O
all  O
the  O
crabs  O
that  O
was  O
prepared  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
claws  O
and  O
legs  O
have  O
the  O
same  O
firmness  O
in  O
its  O
flesh  O
throughout  O
.  O

In  O
terms  O
of  O
taste  O
,  O
it  O
exudes  O
a  O
deep  O
oceanic  O
,  O
rich  O
buttery  O
and  O
slightly  O
sweet  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
the  O
scallop  O
like  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
Pacific  O
Dungeness  O
Crab  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
hit  O
with  O
Singaporean  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
readily  O
available  O
.  O

Ithas  O
also  O
excelled  O
in  O
the  O
different  O
localcooking  O
styles  O
which  O
can  O
satisfy  O
all  O
the  O
different  O
Singaporean  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
a  O
great  O
thank  O
you  O
to  O
both  O
Marshal  O
and  O
Stefanie  O
for  O
the  O
invitation  O
and  O
wonderful  O

Quite  O
sometime  O
back  O
I  O
went  O
back  O
to  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
with  O
a  O
few  O
friends  O
.  O

Actually  O
wanted  O
to  O
introduce  O
them  O
to  O
the  O
Cool  O
Noodles  O
here  O
after  O
we  O
were  O
all  O
too  O
full  O
after  O
a  O
food  O
tasting  O
session  O
.  O

We  O
ended  O
up  O
having  O
tea  O
and  O
cakes  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
interested  O
to  O
read  O
about  O

The  O
core  O
business  O
of  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
is  O
still  O
their  O
Baumkuchens  O
.  O

Baumkuchen  O
is  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
layered  O
cake  O
origin  O
from  O
Germany.It  O
is  O
literally  O
translated  O
as  O
``  O
tree  O
cake  O
''  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
rings  O
formed  O
from  O
the  O
different  O
layers  O
of  O
the  O
cake  O
.  O

Baumkuchen  O
was  O
later  O
introduced  O
in  O
Japan  O
and  O
became  O
popular  O
.  O

Green  O
Tea  O
Baumkuchen  O
4/5  O
For  O
the  O
plain  O
Baumkuchens  O
,  O
we  O
shared  O
the  O
Green  O
Tea  O
and  O
Classic  O
Original  O
flavours  O
.  O

Actually  O
Baumkuchen  O
resembles  O
Kueh  O
Lapis  O
.  O

another  O
type  O
of  O
layered  O
cake  O
that  O
is  O
popular  O
in  O
South  O
East  O
Asia  O
.  O

However  O
Baumkuchen  O
has  O
a  O
firmer  O
texture  O
and  O
at  O
least  O
at  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
there  O
are  O
different  O
flavours  O
to  O
cater  O
for  O
different  O
palates  O
.  O

Classic  O
Original  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
innovative  O
and  O
creative  O
of  O
Wheat  O
Baumkuchen  O
to  O
transform  O
the  O
traditional  O
Baumkuchen  O
into  O
a  O
modern  O
delicacy  O
with  O
different  O
toppings  O
like  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
cupcakes  O
.  O

These  O
injection  O
of  O
modern  O
elements  O
into  O
a  O
traditional  O
snack  O
definitely  O
will  O
help  O
to  O
capture  O
the  O
taste  O
buds  O
of  O
the  O
new  O
generations  O

Just  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O

is  O
a  O

This  O

The  O
firstthing  O
that  O
caught  O
my  O
eyes  O
was  O
the  O
steamed  O
Minced  O
PorkPattythat  O
was  O
shaped  O
into  O
a  O
huge  O
ball  O
shape  O

The  O
patty  O
was  O
nicely  O
marinated  O
with  O
a  O
springy  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
firm  O

springy  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
was  O
also  O
too  O
sweet  O
for  O
me.I  O
would  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
on  O
the  O
spicy  O
side  O

When  O
Charlene  O
told  O
me  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
to  O
look  O
up  O
on  O
the  O
web  O
and  O
found  O
several  O
results  O
.  O

Some  O
sites  O
refer  O
this  O
placeas  O
``  O
Wen  O
Dao  O
Shi  O
''  O
while  O
others  O
called  O
it  O
``  O
126  O
Dim  O
Sum  O
''  O
.  O

After  O
piecing  O
the  O
different  O
information  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
they  O
are  O
referring  O
to  O
the  O
same  O
place  O
.  O

Actually  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
wondering  O
why  O
the  O
Dim  O
Sum  O
place  O
is  O
called  O
Wen  O
Dao  O
Shi  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
it  O
sounds  O
quite  O
funny  O
in  O
Chinese  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
pointed  O
out  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
actuallypronounced  O
as  O
``  O
Wan  O
Dou  O
Sek  O
''  O
in  O
Cantonese  O
,  O
meaning  O
found  O
a  O
place  O
to  O
eat  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
the  O
stall  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
unit  O
126  O
which  O
also  O
sounds  O
like  O
``  O
Wan  O
Dou  O
Sek  O
''  O
(  O
``  O

)  O
.  O

The  O
Egg  O
Tart  O
was  O
not  O
the  O
flaky  O

type.It  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
glossy  O
and  O
shiny  O
surface  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
softbut  O
rather  O
average  O

Following  O
the  O
phenomenon  O
of  O
Bubble  O
Tea  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
the  O
new  O
version  O
of  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
has  O
followed  O
.  O

This  O
type  O
of  O
beancurd  O
is  O
unlike  O
your  O
tradition  O
beancurd  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
sweeter  O
,  O
smoother  O
and  O
has  O
a  O
pudding  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
was  O
invented  O
by  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
Soya  O
Beancurdat  O
Old  O
Airport  O
Road  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
popular  O
that  O
it  O
opened  O
another  O
stall  O
at  O
Maxwell  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Lately  O
,  O
many  O
stalls  O
have  O
also  O
followed  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
Soya  O
Beancurd  O
and  O
started  O
selling  O
the  O
chilled  O
version  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
can  O
now  O
be  O
founded  O
at  O
almost  O
every  O
corner  O
of  O
Singapore  O
.  O

At  O
Toa  O
Payoh  O
Lorong  O
8  O
Food  O
Centre  O
,  O
I  O
noticed  O
2  O
stalls  O
selling  O
it  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
.  O

After  O
my  O
dinner  O
at  O
Toa  O
Payoh  O
Lorong  O
8  O
Food  O
Centre  O
,  O
I  O
bought  O
4  O
tubs  O
of  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
home  O
from  O
B  O
for  O
Beancurd  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
uses  O
100  O
%  O
organic  O
soya  O
beancurd  O
for  O
their  O
beancurd  O
.  O

What  O
interests  O
me  O
is  O
they  O
have  O
different  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
bought  O
the  O
strawberry  O
,  O
chocolate  O
,  O
yam  O
and  O
original  O
flavours  O
.  O

They  O
also  O
have  O
almond  O
,  O
peanut  O
,  O
green  O
teaand  O
blueberry  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
chilled  O
beancurd  O
was  O
nice  O
and  O
smooth  O
comparable  O
to  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
Soya  O
Beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
sweet  O
though  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
4  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
original  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
strawberry  O
and  O
yam  O
flavours  O
were  O
not  O
distinct  O
while  O
the  O
chocolate  O
version  O
tasted  O
more  O
like  O
Milo  O

The  O

cost  O

10.80  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
rather  O
expensive  O
and  O
not  O

us  O

when  O

The  O

was  O
not  O
enough  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O

The  O
iconic  O
dish  O
for  O
any  O
Spanish  O
restaurant  O
would  O
be  O
the  O
Paella  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
sort  O
of  O
a  O
National  O
dish  O
regarded  O
by  O
most  O
originating  O
from  O
Valencia  O
.  O

The  O
Paella  O
at  O
Serenity  O
uses  O
Boomba  O
rice  O
,  O
a  O
short  O
grain  O
varietal  O
.  O

This  O
type  O
of  O
grain  O
is  O
able  O
to  O
absorb  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
3  O
times  O
more  O
than  O
normal  O
rice  O
.  O

Similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chineseclaypot  O
rice  O
,  O
Paella  O
is  O
enjoyed  O
with  O
a  O
slight  O
burnt  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
base  O
of  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

Paella  O
Valenciana  O
We  O
have  O
both  O
the  O

(  O

,  O
Spanish  O

,  O

ink  O
,  O

,  O
tiger  O

,  O
capsicum  O
,  O
rice  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
nature  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
were  O
well  O
absorbed  O
by  O
the  O
grain  O
infusing  O
the  O
dish  O
with  O
more  O
flavours  O
.  O

Arroz  O
Negro  O
The  O
Paellas  O
are  O
prepared  O
freshly  O
to  O
orderand  O
it  O
takes  O
30-45  O
minutes  O
of  O
preparation  O
time  O
.  O

So  O
remember  O
to  O
order  O
early  O
to  O
avoid  O
a  O
long  O
wait  O

craving  O
for  O
some  O
French  O
fare  O
,  O

can  O
check  O
out  O
this  O
tiny  O
eatery  O
at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
Serene  O

is  O
a  O
casual  O

where  O
one  O
needs  O
to  O
place  O
their  O

By  O
the  O
time  O
I  O
was  O
there  O
for  O
dinner  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
about  O
9pm  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
but  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
already  O
sold  O
out  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
settle  O
for  O
what  O
was  O
still  O
available  O
.  O

Upon  O
placing  O
the  O
order  O
and  O
making  O

,  O
the  O

Upon  O
being  O
ushered  O
to  O
my  O
table  O
,  O
I  O
noticed  O
the  O
RamenPlay  O
's  O
special  O
Chilli  O
Paste  O
and  O
Garlic  O
Chips  O
placed  O
on  O
the  O

The  O
waiter/waitress  O
also  O
brought  O
a  O
jar  O
of  O
free  O

Stir-fried  O
Chilli  O
Chives  O
.  O

TheChilli  O
Chives  O
did  O
not  O
look  O
appealing  O
so  O
I  O
only  O
took  O
some  O
to  O
try  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
said  O
the  O
taste  O
was  O
very  O
subjective  O
.  O

Stir-fried  O

Chives  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Yaki  O
Gyoza  O
which  O
was  O
pan  O

beautifully  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O

crisp  O
and  O
was  O
notvery  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
always  O
quite  O
sceptical  O
of  O
Ramen  O
restaurants  O
as  O
they  O
always  O
turned  O
out  O
with  O
disappointment  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
surprised  O
that  O
RamenPlay  O
has  O
pretty  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
Ramen  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Sanpou  O

that  O
comes  O
with  O
braised  O
pork  O
cheek  O
,  O
pork  O
loin  O
in  O

siew  O
sauce  O
and  O
braised  O

.  O

The  O
highlight  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
broth  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
thick  O
,  O
flavourful  O
and  O
delicious  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
left  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
greasiness  O
on  O
my  O
lips  O

I  O

The  O

turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O

with  O

of  O

the  O

thenoodle  O

about  O

,  O
the  O
first  O
thing  O
that  O
comes  O
to  O
my  O

is  O
Mutton  O

also  O
known  O
as  O

probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
Mutton  O

in  O

.  O

It  O
was  O
full  O
of  O
rich  O
spicy  O
flavour  O
and  O
not  O
oily  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
chunks  O
of  O
tender  O
mutton  O
.  O

like  O
to  O
eat  O
the  O

after  O

up  O

you  O

We  O

the  O

the  O

was  O
a  O

My  O

shared  O
with  O
me  O
that  O
people  O
usually  O
ordered  O
the  O

version  O
.  O

Maybe  O
the  O
soup  O
version  O
helps  O
to  O
balance  O
the  O
saltiness  O
and  O
make  O
it  O
a  O
more  O
balanced  O
dish  O

has  O
been  O
around  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
10  O

frequent  O
this  O

when  O
I  O
was  O
working  O
at  O

The  O

was  O
nothing  O
to  O
wow  O
about  O
but  O
definitely  O
gave  O
a  O
home  O
cooked  O
feel  O
.  O

The  O
Tonkatsu  O
was  O
interestingly  O
sliced  O
but  O
in  O
a  O
pathetic  O
way  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O

was  O

I  O
was  O
delighted  O
that  O
Jacob  O
chose  O
to  O
give  O
the  O
soup  O
a  O
chunky  O
texture  O

Each  O

was  O
an  O

you  O

how  O
to  O
do  O
so  O
.  O

Microgreens  O
The  O
Main  O
was  O
Duck  O

.  O

Confit  O
is  O
prepared  O
through  O
a  O
tedious  O
process  O
of  O
preservation  O
that  O
consists  O
of  O
salt  O

Jacob  O
has  O
spent  O
a  O
week  O
preparing  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Jacob  O
was  O
very  O
nervous  O
when  O
the  O
main  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

He  O
kept  O
asking  O
us  O
how  O
was  O
the  O
duck  O
confit  O
but  O
in  O
return  O
was  O
only  O
silent  O
.  O

In  O
actual  O
fact  O
we  O
were  O
lost  O
of  O
words  O
,  O
deeply  O
impressed  O
and  O
overwhelmed  O
by  O
Jacob  O

Stepping  O
into  O

is  O
like  O
walking  O
backinto  O
history  O
with  O
a  O
display  O
of  O
traditional  O
biscuit  O
tins  O
on  O
one  O
side  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

On  O
the  O

side  O
is  O
more  O
modern  O
packaging  O
in  O
plastic  O
tubs  O
.  O

The  O
shop  O
itself  O
is  O
like  O
a  O
little  O
museum  O
where  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
traditional  O
biscuits  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
childhood  O
toys  O
and  O
candies  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
almost  O
a  O
hundred  O
types  O
of  O
biscuit  O
varieties  O
available  O
at  O
Biscuit  O
Kings  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
resist  O
buying  O
some  O

after  O
browsing  O
through  O
all  O
the  O

I  O

Penangfood  O
always  O
has  O
a  O
place  O
in  O
Singaporean  O
tummy  O
.  O

I  O
guess  O
this  O
is  O
because  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
similarity  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
such  O
as  O
Laksa  O
,  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
,  O
Prawn  O
Noodle  O
and  O
etc  O
but  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
of  O
Penang  O
flavour  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
a  O
few  O
reviews  O
on  O
Penang  O
Road  O

,  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
at  O
Novena  O

.  O

The  O
cafe  O
has  O
a  O
simple  O
decor  O
and  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
limited  O
offering  O
popular  O
Penang  O
dishes  O
such  O
as  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
,  O
Assam  O
Laksa  O
,  O
Prawn  O
Noodle  O
and  O
Lor  O
Bak  O
.  O

The  O
Assam  O
Laksa  O
was  O
pretty  O
decent  O
however  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
soup  O
was  O
not  O
robust  O
enough  O
.  O

It  O
lacked  O
the  O
strong  O
sour  O
flavour  O
from  O
the  O
tamarind  O
.  O

A  O
bit  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
shredded  O

fish  O
would  O
also  O
be  O
preferred  O
.  O

The  O

served  O
over  O

The  O

I  O
last  O
visited  O
this  O

in  O
August  O
last  O

and  O
you  O

Except  O
that  O
the  O

has  O
expanded  O
buying  O
the  O

,  O
nothing  O
has  O
changed  O
.  O

The  O
Bak  O

served  O
in  O
claypot  O
was  O
still  O
as  O
good  O
with  O
tender  O
pork  O
ribs  O
that  O
slipped  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
easily  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
mixed  O
claypot  O
hence  O
it  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
other  O
pig  O

and  O

it  O

I  O
tried  O
their  O

for  O

at  O
$  O

which  O
came  O
with  O
a  O

.  O

I  O
thought  O
I  O
was  O
a  O
catch  O
for  O
premium  O
meat  O
at  O
such  O
price  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
disappointed  O
when  O
I  O
realizedthe  O
selection  O
was  O
limited  O
and  O
the  O

meal  O
excluded  O

,  O

I  O
ended  O
up  O
ordering  O
the  O
Salmon  O
and  O
Lamb  O

.  O

I  O
wanted  O
my  O
Lamb  O
Chop  O
medium  O
not  O
it  O
was  O
overcooked  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
both  O
the  O

and  O

were  O
good  O
but  O
not  O
great  O

I  O
tried  O
their  O
Beef  O

which  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
.  O

However  O
the  O

was  O
good  O
and  O

I  O
visited  O
the  O
coffeeshop  O
intending  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Shantou  O
Shi  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
but  O
was  O
surprised  O
that  O
it  O
has  O
changed  O
to  O
Tian  O
Wai  O
Tian  O
Fishhead  O
Steamboat  O
.  O

Is  O
this  O
the  O
popular  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
?  O

When  O
have  O
they  O
taken  O
over  O
and  O
have  O
another  O
branch  O
in  O
Kovan  O
?  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
happy  O
to  O
be  O
trying  O
out  O
another  O
popular  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
more  O
spacious  O
here  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O
branch  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
.  O

The  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
here  O
uses  O
charcoal  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
base  O
was  O
very  O
rich  O
in  O
flavor  O
but  O
my  O
partner  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
that  O
the  O
steamboat  O
size  O
were  O
all  O
the  O
same  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
fish  O
depending  O
on  O
the  O
portion  O
you  O
order  O
.  O

Fish  O

4/5  O
Having  O
the  O

Steamboat  O
alone  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
boring  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
.  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
nice  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
found  O
prawns  O
inside  O
the  O
rolls  O
unlike  O
most  O
places  O
whereby  O
they  O
always  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
why  O
it  O
is  O
called  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
while  O
I  O
could  O
n't  O
find  O
any  O
prawns  O
in  O
them  O
.  O

The  O
O'Coffee  O

or  O
commonly  O
known  O
as  O
Coffee  O
Club  O
has  O
a  O
branch  O
at  O
Changi  O

The  O

O'Coffee  O

was  O

so  O
my  O

and  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
terminal  O

for  O
lunch  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Black  O

.  O

It  O
has  O
tender  O
slices  O
of  O

,  O
arranged  O
over  O

of  O

topped  O
with  O

and  O

.  O

The  O
cream  O

was  O
really  O
``  O

but  O
felt  O
cheated  O
as  O
the  O

A  O
great  O
thank  O
you  O
to  O
Charles  O
and  O
Charlene  O
for  O
organising  O
August  O
monthly  O
makam  O
gathering  O
.  O

We  O
visited  O
Xu  O
Jun  O
Sheng  O
at  O
Joo  O
Jiat  O
Road  O
for  O
its  O
traditional  O
Teochew  O
cuisine  O
and  O
porridge  O
.  O

This  O
place  O
has  O
60  O
years  O
of  O
history  O
and  O
has  O
moved  O
from  O
its  O
previous  O
locationfrom  O
50  O
JooChiat  O
Road  O
to  O
121  O
JooChiat  O

.  O

Unlike  O
most  O
Teochew  O
Porridge  O
places  O
whereby  O
you  O
ordered  O
from  O
the  O
row  O
of  O
cooked  O
food  O
,  O
you  O
are  O
given  O
a  O
pencil  O
to  O
indicate  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
what  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
order  O
.  O

ThePrawn  O
Rollswere  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
eaten  O
.  O

I  O
googled  O
and  O
read  O
that  O
they  O
used  O
pork  O
mesentary  O
to  O
wrap  O
the  O
fillings  O
.  O

Maybe  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
secret  O
of  O
the  O
crispy  O
outer  O
layer  O
.  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
were  O
also  O
sliced  O
thinner  O
but  O
bigger  O
in  O
diameter  O
which  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
other  O
places  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
great  O
fan  O
for  O
Prawn  O
Rolls  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
this  O
a  O

this  O

had  O

We  O
were  O
very  O
curious  O
and  O
asked  O
the  O
server  O
to  O
order  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Mullet  O
prepared  O
without  O
any  O
seasoning  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
fresh  O
and  O
tasty  O

It  O
does  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O

smell  O
.  O

Teochew  O

how  O
can  O
we  O
not  O
try  O
it  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
both  O
the  O
Braised  O
Platter  O
and  O
Pig  O
Trotters  O
.  O

The  O
Braised  O
Platter  O
had  O
both  O
big  O
and  O
small  O
pig  O
intestines  O
,  O
beancurds  O
and  O

skins  O
.  O

The  O
innards  O
,  O

and  O

were  O
well  O

was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
that  O
most  O
of  O
it  O
was  O
lean  O
meat  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
I  O
took  O
the  O
one  O
and  O
only  O
fatty  O
piece  O
.  O

While  O
writing  O
this  O
post  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
the  O
menu  O
allows  O
us  O
to  O
indicate  O
either  O
tendon  O
or  O
thigh  O
for  O
the  O
Pig  O
Trotters  O
which  O
we  O
left  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

Maybe  O
that  O
was  O
the  O
reason  O
they  O
have  O
given  O
us  O
mostly  O
lean  O
meat  O
.  O

that  O
made  O
this  O

so  O

It  O
was  O
so  O

that  O
I  O

my  O

the  O

It  O
tasted  O
good  O

I  O
was  O
puzzled  O
by  O
the  O

whereby  O
it  O
came  O
with  O

It  O
was  O

by  O

so  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

The  O
roast  O
porkwas  O
big  O
and  O
juicy  O
with  O
crispy  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

I  O
am  O
going  O
to  O
introduce  O
you  O
to  O
their  O
new  O
menu  O
,  O
COOL  O
NOODLE  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
first  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Anewconcept  O
ofeating  O
noodles  O
in  O
a  O
healthyand  O
cool  O
refreshingway.There  O
are  O
5  O
types  O
of  O
Cool  O
Noodle  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
at  O
$  O
4.80  O
per  O
plate  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
named  O
as  O
Dolphin  O
,  O
Polar  O
Bear  O
,  O
Penguin  O
,  O
Seal  O
and  O
Reindeer  O
.  O

The  O
Seal  O
Cool  O
Noodle  O
comes  O
with  O
white  O
noodles  O
in  O
roasted  O
sesame  O
sauce  O
with  O
sauteed  O
pork  O
,  O
tofu  O
,  O
carrot  O
and  O
cucumber  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
scepticalhow  O
by  O
simply  O
putting  O
some  O
salad  O
and  O
cold  O
noodle  O
together  O
can  O
makea  O
tasty  O
noodle  O
dish  O
.  O

After  O
tasting  O
it  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
applaud  O
the  O
concept  O
and  O
the  O
roasted  O
sesame  O
sauce  O
really  O
brought  O
the  O
dish  O
together  O
.  O

The  O
show  O
Timeless  O
Treats  O
(  O
)  O
had  O
brought  O
to  O
my  O
attention  O
this  O
traditional  O
steamboat  O
place  O
hidden  O
at  O
the  O
basement  O
of  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Tower  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
challenging  O
locating  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
to  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Complex  O
initially  O
and  O
could  O
n't  O
find  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
seek  O
a  O
shopkeeper  O
's  O
help  O
in  O
direction  O
and  O
she  O
directed  O
me  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Actually  O
Thien  O
Kee  O
Steamboat  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Tower  O
another  O
building  O
beside  O
Golden  O
Mile  O
Complex  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
linked  O
by  O
a  O
basement  O
walkway  O
which  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
walk  O
pass  O
some  O
discotheque  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
was  O
already  O
crowded  O
with  O
people  O
when  O
I  O
reached  O
there  O
around  O
6pm  O
.  O

Ordering  O
is  O
pretty  O
simple  O
as  O
the  O
steamboat  O
set  O
is  O
standard  O
.  O

Basically  O
you  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
provide3  O
details  O
to  O
the  O
waiter/waitress  O
,  O
number  O
of  O
people  O
,  O
whether  O
you  O
eat  O
beef  O
and  O
you  O
want  O
boiled  O
white  O
chicken  O
.  O

The  O
ingredients  O
for  O
the  O
steamboat  O
were  O
fresh  O
but  O
portion  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
tender  O
but  O
not  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
quality  O
.  O

For  O
people  O
who  O
are  O
used  O
to  O
flavored  O
soup  O
based  O
may  O
find  O
the  O
traditional  O
steamboat  O
soup  O
base  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
bland  O
for  O
their  O
liking  O
.  O

Marble  O
Slab  O
Creameryoriginated  O
from  O
Houston  O
,  O
Texas  O
in  O
1983  O
.  O

Although  O
it  O
does  O
not  O
offer  O
exotic  O
local  O
ice  O
cream  O
flavours  O
such  O
as  O
D24  O

Mao  O

,  O
Kaya  O

and  O
etc  O
,  O

is  O
still  O
rich  O
and  O
creamy  O
freshly  O
made  O
daily  O
in  O
small  O
batches  O
in  O
their  O
central  O
creamery  O
.  O

What  O
makes  O
Marble  O
Slab  O
Creamery  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
other  O
ice  O
cream  O
shops  O
is  O
their  O
Mixins  O
or  O
Mix-in  O
.  O

Basically  O
they  O
are  O
toppings  O
but  O
are  O
n't  O
toppings  O
because  O
they  O
get  O
mixed  O
into  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

After  O
selecting  O
your  O
toppings  O
,  O
thestaff  O
will  O
flatten  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
on  O
the  O
cold  O
table  O
top  O
and  O
mix  O
them  O
into  O
the  O

.  O

From  O
what  O
I  O

,  O

a  O

of  O
days  O
for  O
work  O
.  O

My  O
first  O
meal  O
in  O
Seoul  O
was  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
I  O
was  O
amazed  O
by  O
the  O
extendable  O
chimney  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
pork  O
from  O
the  O
Jeju  O
Black  O
Pig  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
good  O

Eating  O

a  O
piece  O

up  O

all  O
the  O

stuff  O
,  O
this  O
bowl  O
of  O
iced  O
cold  O

was  O

In  O
Korea  O
,  O
how  O
can  O
a  O
meal  O
go  O
without  O
alcohol  O
?  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
Korean  O
rice  O
wine  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Makgeolli  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
like  O
beer  O
but  O
sweeter  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
gassy  O
.  O


I  O
was  O
at  O
Vivocity  O

for  O
dinner  O
and  O
the  O

was  O

I  O

and  O

For  O
the  O
main  O
,  O
I  O
chose  O
my  O
favourite  O
Pu  O
Tien  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
to  O
call  O
it  O
White  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
those  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
we  O
get  O
from  O
food  O
centres  O
which  O
is  O
black  O
in  O
colour  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
to  O
eat  O
it  O
with  O
some  O
vinegar  O
.  O

at  O

.  O

Although  O
Sweet  O
&  O
Sour  O
Pork  O
is  O
a  O
common  O
dish  O
,  O
not  O
many  O
restaurant  O
can  O
do  O
it  O
well  O
.  O

Personally  O
I  O
find  O
Pu  O
Tien  O
is  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
mark  O
for  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Wang  O
Lao  O
Wu  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
name  O
in  O
the  O
food  O
scene  O
selling  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

Within  O
3  O
months  O
,  O
the  O
group  O
has  O
already  O
opened  O
5  O
outlets  O
around  O
Singapore  O
.  O

They  O
even  O
give  O
out  O
150  O
free  O
packets  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
to  O
the  O
needy  O
senior  O
citizen  O
in  O
Singapore  O
on  O
every  O
1st  O
and  O
15th  O
of  O
the  O
month  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
that  O
the  O
catchy  O
name  O
Wang  O
Lao  O
Wu  O
(  O
)  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
and  O
not  O
the  O
food  O
initially  O
.  O

After  O
studying  O
the  O
posters  O
placed  O
around  O
the  O
outlet  O
,  O
it  O
kinda  O
of  O
convinced  O
me  O
to  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
try  O
.  O

The  O
pricing  O
at  O
Wang  O
Lao  O
Wu  O
Chicken  O
Rice  O
is  O
quite  O
reasonable  O
.  O

$  O
4.90  O
for  O
a  O
chicken  O
set  O
meal  O
and  O
$  O
3.80  O
for  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
boiled  O
white  O
chicken  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
still  O
came  O
short  O
to  O
more  O
established  O

A  O

After  O
a  O
two  O
month  O
's  O
wait  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
so  O
excitedto  O
know  O
that  O
Penang  O
Place  O
Restaurant  O
will  O
reopen  O
at  O
its  O
new  O

After  O
being  O
introduced  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
located  O
at  O
International  O
Business  O
Park  O
,  O
whenever  O
I  O
have  O
craving  O
for  O
Penang  O
cuisine  O
,  O
Penang  O
Place  O
Restaurant  O
always  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
come  O
to  O
my  O
mind  O
.  O

Our  O
July  O
's  O
foodies  O
and  O
twitter  O
friends  O
gathering  O
was  O
coming  O
up  O
so  O
I  O
suggested  O
the  O
Penang  O
Place  O
Restaurant  O
since  O
most  O
of  O
them  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
also  O
a  O
bit  O
nervous  O
whether  O
the  O
food  O
will  O
be  O
up  O
to  O
their  O
mark  O
.  O

The  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
is  O
verypopular  O
here  O
.  O

Being  O
been  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
I  O
know  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
will  O
disappear  O
from  O
the  O
buffet  O
linein  O
an  O
instant.When  O
I  O
walked  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Istole  O
a  O
glance  O
at  O
the  O
buffet  O
line  O
and  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
's  O
trap  O
was  O
empty  O
!  O

Lucky  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
big  O
group  O
and  O
we  O
can  O
take  O
turns  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
buffet  O
line  O
for  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
delighted  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
was  O
still  O
as  O
good.I  O
also  O
breathed  O
a  O
sigh  O
of  O
relief  O
when  O
the  O
group  O
commented  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O

with  O
bean  O

,  O
prawns  O
,  O

and  O

also  O
had  O
the  O

smell  O
.  O

After  O
my  O
dinner  O
at  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Street  O
Chun  O
Tat  O
Kee  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
have  O
some  O
space  O
for  O
dessert  O
so  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
N  O
&  O
B  O

at  O
the  O
HDB  O

The  O

has  O
a  O
simple  O
interior  O
design  O
and  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
fridge  O
to  O
store  O
the  O
Soya  O
Bean  O

and  O
Beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Soya  O
Bean  O
Milk  O
with  O
Peanut  O
Dumplings  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
dessert  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
enjoy  O
all  O
three  O

my  O
likings  O
,  O
Soya  O

Both  O
the  O

were  O
fresh  O
and  O
smooth  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
was  O
the  O

Potong  O

is  O
conveniently  O
located  O
along  O
the  O
North  O
East  O
MRT  O
line  O
from  O
where  O
I  O
staybut  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
there  O
.  O

Hence  O
Itook  O
the  O
train  O
and  O
went  O
down  O
to  O
explore  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
thiseatinghouseopposite  O
the  O
Indian  O
temple  O
which  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
diners  O
.  O

Most  O
of  O
the  O
diners  O
were  O
having  O
Zi  O
Char  O
from  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Street  O
Chun  O

.  O

I  O
have  O
heard  O
of  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
Street  O
Chun  O
Tat  O
Kee  O
at  O
Balestier  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
there  O
is  O
one  O
at  O
Potong  O
Pasir  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
crowdcould  O
n't  O
be  O
wrong  O
so  O
I  O
settled  O
for  O
dinner  O
at  O
the  O
eating  O
house  O
.  O

The  O
Braised  O
Fish  O
Headcooked  O
withBittergourd  O
and  O
black  O
sauce  O
wasgood  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

The  O
braised  O
fish  O
head  O
was  O
chopped  O
into  O
small  O
pieces  O
and  O
absorbed  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
black  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
also  O
helped  O
tocover  O
off  O
the  O
bitterness  O
of  O
the  O
bittergound  O
.  O

Kids  O
eating  O
this  O
dish  O
have  O
to  O
be  O
careful  O
because  O
it  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
bones  O
and  O
sometimes  O
the  O
fish  O
head  O
was  O
not  O

I  O
blamed  O
myself  O
for  O
not  O
doing  O
more  O
research  O
beforevisiting  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
read  O
so  O
many  O
good  O
reviews  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
but  O
never  O
took  O
note  O
of  O
the  O
dishes  O
to  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
ended  O
up  O
ordering  O
the  O
following  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
Thai  O
Vegetable  O
Omelette  O
with  O
Spicy  O
Thai  O
Blachan  O
was  O
something  O
unique  O
and  O
interesting  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
before  O
.  O

The  O
omelette  O
unfortunately  O
was  O
too  O
dried  O
to  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

The  O

definitely  O
gave  O
a  O

for  O

,  O
the  O

dried  O
up  O
the  O

and  O
became  O

are  O
very  O
popular  O
and  O
well  O
known  O
but  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
at  O
the  O
Worker  O
Party  O
's  O

at  O
Bedok  O

for  O
the  O
East  O

and  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
stalls  O
for  O
supper  O
since  O
I  O
was  O
nearby  O
.  O

It  O
took  O
me  O
quite  O
a  O
while  O
to  O
decide  O
which  O
Bak  O
Chor  O
Mee  O
stall  O
to  O
patron  O
.  O

Both  O
stallsare  O
side  O

side  O
and  O
had  O
long  O
queues.I  O
decided  O
on  O

because  O
of  O
the  O

wait  O
45  O

for  O
my  O

The  O

only  O
sells  O
the  O

version  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
minced  O
meat  O
,  O
meat  O
balls  O
and  O
cut  O

The  O
noodles  O
were  O
Q  O
and  O
springy  O
.  O

The  O

werefirmand  O
nice  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
slurping  O
good  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
disappointmentwas  O
the  O
minced  O
meat  O
.  O

I  O
find  O
it  O
too  O
fine  O
and  O
could  O
not  O
taste  O
them  O
in  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
having  O
the  O
cut  O
red  O
chilli  O
with  O
the  O
noodles  O
and  O
asked  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
the  O
stall  O
owner  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
happy  O
thatI  O
asked  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
what  O
was  O
given  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
lady  O
I  O
approached  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
was  O
very  O
nice  O
and  O
asked  O
me  O
to  O

decided  O
to  O
walk  O
down  O
Joo  O

it  O
was  O

the  O

were  O
sold  O
out  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
quite  O

It  O
had  O

thatthere  O
were  O

into  O
the  O

that  O

much  O

The  O
size  O

just  O
right  O

can  O
be  O
easily  O
handled  O
with  O
both  O

The  O

The  O

was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O

brown  O

The  O
fish  O
itself  O
was  O
bland  O
in  O
flavour  O
but  O
when  O
eaten  O
with  O
the  O
lemony  O
sauce  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
flavouring  O
.  O

We  O
only  O
wished  O
that  O
there  O
were  O
more  O

as  O
the  O

quite  O
big  O

I  O
was  O
wondering  O
around  O
Albert  O
Centre  O
Food  O
Centre  O
thinking  O
what  O
to  O
eat  O
for  O
dinner  O
and  O
I  O
noticed  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
having  O
congee  O
that  O
was  O
served  O
instyrofoam  O
bowl  O
.  O

I  O
started  O
looking  O
for  O
the  O
stall  O
and  O
foundit  O
tucked  O
at  O
a  O
corner  O
with  O
a  O
long  O
queue  O
.  O

I  O
looked  O
up  O
the  O
web  O
and  O
I  O
realized  O
that  O
Li  O
Fang  O
Zhou  O
Pin  O
(  O
)  O
has  O
several  O
branches  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
stall  O
at  O
ABC  O
Brickworks  O
Food  O
Centre  O
and  O
another  O
at  O
Yuhua  O
Market  O
and  O
Hawker  O

.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
able  O
to  O
verify  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
original  O
stall  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
wise  O
idea  O
to  O
serve  O
instyrofoam  O
bowl.What  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
understand  O
is  O
for  O
takeaway  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
used  O
plastic  O
bowl  O
instead  O
for  O
an  O
additional  O
20  O
cents  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Congee  O
in  O
Boat  O
Style  O
which  O
is  O
basically  O
congess  O
with  O
sliced  O
fish  O
,  O
cuttlefish  O
,  O
chives  O
and  O
peanuts  O
.  O

The  O
congee  O
was  O
smoothy  O
and  O
not  O
watery  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
Youtiao  O
(  O

which  O
was  O
crisp  O
and  O
warm  O
,  O
giving  O
a  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
years  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
comes  O
in  O
two  O
sections  O
.  O

One  O
section  O
for  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
for  O

My  O
friendsopted  O
for  O
the  O
ala  O
carte  O
and  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
first  O
servicing  O
came  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
feeling  O
disappointed  O
that  O
thevarieties  O
ofside  O
dishes  O
in  O
Korean  O
cuisinehave  O
shrunk  O
to  O
just  O
3  O
small  O
portions  O
on  O
a  O
single  O
plate  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
that  O
the  O
restaurant  O
served  O
some  O
sort  O
of  O
Amus  O
Bouche  O
which  O
was  O
unexpected  O
for  O
a  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
potato  O
salad  O
,  O
anchovies  O
(  O
Ikan  O
Bilis  O
)  O
and  O
black  O
peas  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
potato  O
salad  O
and  O
anchovies  O
were  O
ok  O
but  O
nothing  O
Korean  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
beans  O
were  O
hard  O
which  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
really  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

Now  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
part  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
spread  O
of  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
pancakes  O
were  O
a  O
bit  O
tasteless  O
to  O
me  O
butthey  O
werenice  O
and  O
not  O
too  O
floury  O

which  O
is  O
known  O
as  O

in  O

is  O
a  O
summer  O
dish  O
that  O
consists  O
of  O
a  O
whole  O
chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
glutinous  O

inKorean  O

first  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
the  O

will  O
be  O
too  O
heavy  O
with  O
ginseng  O
flavour  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
not  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
also  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
and  O
tender  O

a  O

It  O

for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
I  O
ate  O
three  O
quarter  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
alone  O
.  O

However  O
this  O
dish  O
is  O
not  O

for  O
children  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O

and  O

to  O
be  O
taken  O
eating  O

from  O
the  O

)  O
when  O

quite  O
a  O

The  O

it  O

The  O

It  O
was  O

.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O

However  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
remove  O
the  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
underneath  O
the  O
skin  O
as  O
it  O
had  O
some  O

which  O
I  O
did  O
not  O

for  O
me  O
at  O
Dining  O
Codes  O
is  O
Cheong  O

.  O

The  O
fried  O
fish  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
and  O
different  O
from  O
most  O
eateries  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
marinated  O
before  O
it  O
was  O
fried  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
tasty  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O

Well  O
,  O
it  O

another  O

on  O

is  O
the  O

a  O

were  O
a  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Curry  O

.  O

I  O
always  O
prefer  O
yellow  O
noodles  O
with  O
curry  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
gravy  O
was  O
really  O
thick  O
and  O
flavouring  O
.  O

The  O
thickness  O
probably  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
coconut  O
milk  O
added  O
which  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O

The  O

The  O

I  O
was  O
asking  O
my  O
Pakistan  O
colleague  O
of  O
any  O
nice  O
Indian  O
restaurants  O
at  O
Little  O
India  O
the  O
other  O
day  O
and  O
the  O
following  O
day  O
he  O
brought  O
me  O
to  O
this  O
little  O
old  O
80  O

in  O

India  O
at  O
the  O

I  O
suspect  O
this  O

should  O
be  O
quite  O
well  O
known  O
when  O
I  O
saw  O
a  O
Caucasian  O
family  O

at  O

I  O
googled  O

indeed  O
this  O

of  O

left  O
the  O

I  O
have  O
my  O
first  O
tried  O
on  O

at  O
my  O

We  O
ordered  O
our  O
food  O
from  O

It  O
has  O
quite  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
menu  O
and  O
we  O
went  O
for  O

Besides  O
the  O

which  O
was  O

,  O
everyone  O
was  O

with  O
the  O

I  O
was  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Plaza  O
and  O
walked  O
into  O
a  O
half  O
filled  O
restaurant  O
during  O
lunch  O
time  O
.  O

It  O
always  O
puzzled  O
me  O
whenever  O
I  O
stepped  O
into  O
Coffee  O
Club  O
to  O
see  O
empty  O
tables  O
during  O
lunch  O
or  O
dinner  O
time  O
.  O

The  O
food  O
dished  O
out  O
at  O
Coffee  O
Club  O
are  O
of  O
good  O
quality  O
and  O
standard  O
.  O

The  O
price  O
is  O
also  O
comparable  O
to  O
other  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Could  O
it  O
be  O
the  O
restaurant  O
name  O
that  O
gives  O
the  O
misconception  O
?  O

Anyway  O
...  O
at  O
least  O
I  O
need  O
not  O
queue  O
whenever  O
I  O
visited  O
Coffee  O
Club  O
.  O

I  O
browsed  O
through  O
the  O
menu  O
and  O
realized  O
they  O
have  O
introduced  O
a  O
few  O
new  O
dishes  O
since  O
my  O
last  O
visit  O
.  O

I  O
settledfor  O
the  O
Herb  O
Crumbed  O

and  O
Mexican  O
Quessadilla  O

The  O
herb  O
crust  O

the  O

fillet  O
was  O
crispy  O

giving  O
it  O
a  O

The  O

is  O
quite  O
popular  O
so  O
do  O
expect  O
a  O
long  O
wait  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
important  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
stall  O
is  O
the  O
satay  O
sauce  O
.  O

Unlike  O
others  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
added  O
pineapple  O
in  O
its  O
satay  O
sauce  O
which  O
was  O

about  O
20-25  O

as  O

my  O
A  O

After  O
shopping  O
,  O
dinner  O
was  O
at  O
Golden  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
restaurant  O
built  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
a  O

.  O

I  O
suspected  O
it  O
is  O
aprawn  O

which  O
was  O
how  O
the  O

came  O
about  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
another  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Golden  O

beside  O
it  O

Both  O
restaurants  O
should  O
be  O
owned  O
by  O
the  O

since  O
the  O

came  O

both  O
the  O

the  O

The  O

different  O
from  O

version  O

very  O

love  O

Previosuly  O

I  O
have  O
written  O
a  O
post  O
on  O
VeganBurg  O
stating  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
selling  O
vegetarian  O
burgers  O
.  O

Technically  O
I  O
am  O
wrong  O
,  O
the  O
burgers  O
at  O
VeganBurgalso  O
excludes  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
eggs  O
,  O
dairy  O
products  O
and  O
other  O
animal-derived  O
ingredients  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
VeganBurg  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
their  O
burgers  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
way  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
amazed  O
by  O
how  O
tasty  O
the  O
burgers  O
were  O
even  O
though  O
it  O
excludes  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
meat  O
and  O
animal-derived  O
ingredients  O
.  O

This  O
time  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Hawaiian  O
Pineapple  O
burger  O
.  O

The  O
soya  O

tasty  O

The  O

gave  O
the  O

a  O
freshness  O

too  O

I  O
encouraged  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O

quite  O
reasonable  O
so  O
I  O
settled  O
for  O
the  O

to  O
have  O
my  O

Both  O
the  O

and  O
side  O

The  O

was  O
nothing  O

basically  O

dishes  O
were  O
decent  O

I  O
knew  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
from  O
fellow  O
food  O
blogger  O
Calvintimowho  O
has  O
been  O
visiting  O
the  O
place  O
almost  O
every  O
week  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
getting  O
suspicious  O
whether  O
he  O
is  O
there  O
for  O
the  O
food  O
or  O
to  O
see  O
the  O
bubbly  O
waitress  O
(  O
joking  O
)  O
.  O

He  O
also  O
organized  O
a  O
food  O
blogger  O
outing  O
at  O
Around  O
De  O
World  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
miss  O
as  O
Iwas  O
away  O
in  O
Melbourne  O
for  O
work  O
.  O

,  O
I  O
made  O
a  O
point  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
for  O
lunch  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
asmall  O
restaurant  O
with  O
about  O
10  O
tables  O
.  O

For  O
drink  O
Ihad  O
the  O
Lemon  O

which  O
was  O
very  O
refreshing  O
and  O
coolingfor  O

I  O
also  O
ordered  O
the  O
Cheesy  O

to  O
share  O
with  O
my  O
partner  O
.  O

Both  O
of  O
us  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
Bolognese  O
was  O
very  O
nice  O
.  O

my  O

I  O
simply  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
with  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
...  O
oh  O
I  O
meant  O
the  O

I  O
also  O
tried  O
a  O

on  O
the  O

.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O

nicely  O
executed  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
was  O
neither  O
too  O
thick  O
or  O

just  O
the  O
right  O

we  O
gave  O
it  O
a  O

.  O

I  O
found  O
it  O
quite  O
nice  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
too  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
at  O
Souperlicious  O
and  O
I  O
found  O
the  O
concept  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
Soup  O
Spoon  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
combo  O
meal  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
a  O
regular  O
soup  O
plus  O
a  O
small  O
salad  O
,  O
pasta  O
or  O
half  O

.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
beef  O
goulashand  O
small  O

.  O

The  O
beef  O
goulash  O
was  O
a  O
thick  O
and  O
rich  O
soup  O
cooked  O
with  O
paprika.It  O
wasfilled  O
with  O
stewed  O
beef  O
cubes  O
,  O
carrots  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

A  O
comfort  O
and  O
filling  O
meal  O
alone  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
spaghetti  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
norm  O
but  O
the  O
meatball  O
stood  O
out  O
.  O

off  O
about  O

is  O
the  O
price  O
on  O
the  O

I  O
ended  O
up  O
paying  O
$  O
10.60  O
for  O
my  O
combo  O
meal  O
instead  O
of  O
$  O
9.90  O
.  O

The  O
food  O
was  O
ordered  O
,  O
paid  O
and  O
collected  O
at  O

so  O
I  O
was  O
not  O

a  O

One  O
of  O
theunforgettable  O

experience  O
during  O
this  O

was  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Beef  O
PhoI  O
ate  O
at  O

.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
quite  O
popular  O
and  O
it  O
wasvery  O
crowded  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
surprised  O
to  O
find  O
such  O
good  O
authentic  O
Pho  O
in  O
Melbourne  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
the  O
Pho  O
2000  O
which  O
I  O
hadin  O

The  O

was  O
served  O

from  O
the  O

of  O

You  O
squeeze  O
the  O

us  O
may  O
have  O
visited  O
Yum  O

Restaurant  O
for  O
its  O

Even  O
the  O
name  O
itself  O

which  O
meant  O
tea  O
drinking  O
in  O

suggested  O
that  O
this  O

place  O

Do  O
n't  O

The  O

offers  O
a  O
good  O

of  O

I  O

Iended  O
up  O

forthe  O

which  O
I  O
found  O
it  O
quite  O

I  O

Hainanese  O

in  O

.  O

I  O
finally  O
found  O
the  O
time  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
not  O
disappointed  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
not  O
much  O
varieties  O
left  O
when  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
chops  O
were  O
unique  O
,  O
crispy  O
and  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

Not  O
the  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
this  O

wondering  O
how  O
an  O
Italian  O
restaurant  O
will  O
present  O
the  O
suckling  O
pig  O
in  O
its  O
menu  O
?  O

I  O
was  O
pleasantly  O

when  O
I  O
am  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
big  O
piece  O
of  O
pork  O
instead  O
in  O
a  O
thin  O
slice  O
where  O
how  O
Chinese  O
restaurant  O
normally  O
served  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
skin  O
was  O
crispy  O
and  O
the  O
pork  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O

A  O
very  O
well  O
executed  O
dish  O
.  O

Roasted  O

4.2/5  O

was  O
creme  O

Simply  O
fell  O
in  O

with  O
the  O

with  O
its  O
moist  O
custard  O
base  O
and  O
burnt  O
caramel  O
on  O
the  O
top  O
.  O

How  O
I  O
wish  O
the  O
restaurant  O
could  O
have  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
bigger  O

was  O

up  O

the  O
starter  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O

skin  O
.  O

The  O
dip  O
for  O
the  O
fried  O
fish  O
skin  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
fried  O
fish  O
skin  O
was  O
crispy  O
and  O
nice  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
size  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
compare  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
elsewhere  O
.  O

Next  O
up  O
was  O
fun  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
presented  O
with  O
a  O
tray  O
of  O
12  O
ingredients  O
for  O
us  O
to  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
our  O

.  O

Lastly  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
main  O
.  O

When  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
commotion  O
in  O
the  O
group.We  O
realizedthe  O
prawns  O
were  O
alive  O
and  O
moving  O
.  O

OK  O
!  O

this  O
is  O
really  O
fresh  O
!  O

It  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
a  O
disturbing  O
sight  O
to  O
some  O
when  O
the  O
prawns  O
struggled  O
in  O
the  O
hot  O
steamboat  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O

,  O
the  O

were  O
of  O

Usuallyin  O
a  O

you  O
will  O
find  O
that  O
it  O
is  O

due  O
to  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
sugar  O

in  O

I  O
wonder  O
why  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
called  O

it  O
has  O
a  O

menu  O

Anyway  O

I  O

my  O

and  O
we  O
wanted  O
to  O
have  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
long  O

we  O
were  O
too  O
hungry  O
to  O
wait  O
hence  O
we  O
walked  O

We  O
ordered  O
a  O

Both  O
the  O

The  O

My  O

me  O
here  O
for  O
lunch  O
after  O
our  O
conference  O
at  O
MBS  O
.  O

It  O

at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
Aliwal  O
Street  O
.  O

A  O
queue  O
was  O
already  O
formed  O
when  O
we  O
reached  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

We  O
waited  O
for  O
about  O
half  O
an  O
hourbut  O
it  O
was  O
worthwhile  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
both  O
the  O
fried  O
fish  O
bee  O
hoon  O
and  O
fried  O
fish  O
soup  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
tasty  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
anchovies  O
.  O

One  O
sip  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
and  O
I  O
knew  O
I  O
am  O
won  O
over  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
also  O
very  O
fresh  O
.  O

One  O
bite  O
into  O
the  O
fried  O
fish  O
and  O
how  O
the  O
fish  O
meat  O
broken  O
down  O
,  O
we  O
can  O
tell  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
freshly  O
preparedon  O
the  O
day  O
instead  O
of  O
using  O
frozen  O
fish  O
meat  O
.  O

What  O
wows  O
me  O
more  O
was  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
spinach  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O
egg  O
in  O
the  O
fish  O
soup  O
.  O

The  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O
spinachgave  O
a  O
good  O
balance  O
to  O
the  O
heavy  O
flavouring  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
fried  O
egg  O
was  O
a  O
surprise  O
to  O
me  O
and  O
my  O
first  O
having  O
it  O
for  O
fish  O
soup  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O

My  O
friend  O
and  O
Iwere  O
looking  O
for  O
lunch  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Plaza  O
and  O
came  O
upon  O
this  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
reading  O
about  O
the  O
restaurant  O
owner  O
being  O
an  O
ex  O
drug  O
addict  O
and  O
and  O
worked  O
at  O
Jamie  O
Oliver  O
's  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Fifteen  O
before  O
coming  O
back  O
to  O
Singapore  O
and  O
opening  O
his  O
own  O
restaurant  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
menu  O
for  O
baked  O
rice  O
orpasta  O
beside  O
the  O
normal  O
ala  O

menu  O
.  O

We  O
went  O
for  O
some  O
fun  O
in  O
designing  O
our  O
own  O
baked  O
rice  O
and  O
pasta  O
.  O

A  O
simple  O
four  O
steps  O
whereby  O
you  O
just  O
pick  O
and  O
tick  O
the  O
items  O
on  O

we  O
were  O
a  O

withour  O

The  O

the  O

The  O

was  O
still  O
very  O

big  O

The  O

Unlike  O
Indian  O

,  O
Japanese  O
curry  O
are  O
on  O
the  O

side  O
so  O
it  O
was  O
very  O

to  O
eat  O
with  O
the  O

The  O

was  O
also  O

the  O

was  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
eating  O
at  O
Daikokuya  O
.  O

The  O
ramen  O
restaurant  O
serves  O
four  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
ramen  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
the  O
Sapporo  O
ramen  O
,  O
Tokyo-style  O
ramen  O
,  O
Kyushu-style  O
Tonkoturamen  O
and  O
Kogashi  O
ramen  O
.  O

My  O
friends  O
and  O
I  O
started  O
off  O
with  O
their  O
Gyoza  O
which  O
were  O
nicely  O
pan  O
fried  O
with  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
crispyness  O
to  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

Usually  O
restaurant  O
served  O
black  O
vinegar  O
for  O
the  O
gyoza  O
dip  O
but  O
it  O
used  O
white  O
vinegar  O
here  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
white  O
vinegar  O
with  O
gyoza  O
before  O
and  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
.  O

White  O
Vinegar  O
Gyoza  O
4.2/5  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Kogashi  O
Miso  O
Ramen  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
dark  O
creamy  O
pork  O
broth  O
seasoned  O
with  O
blackish  O
aromatic  O
oil  O
made  O
from  O
charred  O
crushed  O
garlic  O
,  O
served  O
with  O
thin  O
and  O
straight  O
noodles  O
in  O
miso  O
soup  O
based  O
.  O

The  O
noodles  O
and  O
soup  O
were  O
excellent  O
and  O
I  O
basically  O
emptied  O
it  O
Kogashi  O
Miso  O
Ramen  O
My  O
friends  O
had  O
the  O
Kyushu-style  O
Tonkotsu  O
Miso  O
Ramen  O
and  O
Tokyo-style  O
Spicy  O
Miso  O
Ramen  O
.  O

The  O
Kyushu-style  O
Tonkotsu  O
Miso  O
Ramen  O
had  O
a  O
thick  O
creamy  O
pork  O
broth  O
served  O
with  O
thin  O
and  O
straight  O
noodles  O
while  O
the  O
Tokyo-style  O
Spicy  O
Miso  O
Ramen  O
had  O
a  O
lighter  O
chicken  O
broth  O
served  O
with  O
springy  O
and  O
curly  O
noodles  O
,  O
with  O
the  O
chilli  O
served  O
separately  O
.  O

Both  O
my  O

enjoyed  O
their  O
ramen  O
too  O

at  O
Upper  O
Serangoon  O

for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
.  O

Every  O

a  O

During  O
the  O
Mid  O
Autumn  O
Festival  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
buy  O
mooncakes  O
home  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
kind  O
of  O
Chinese  O
tradition  O
that  O
I  O
will  O
do  O
every  O
year  O
.  O

Even  O
companies  O
will  O
send  O
mooncakes  O
to  O
their  O
customers  O
as  O
gift  O
during  O
this  O
festive  O
occasion  O
.  O

Mooncakes  O
nowadays  O
came  O
in  O
all  O
sort  O
of  O
creativity  O
.  O

Even  O
hotels  O
and  O
restaurants  O
came  O
out  O
with  O
their  O
own  O
signature  O
mooncake  O
.  O

Being  O
a  O
durian  O
lover  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
resist  O
buying  O
the  O
Peony  O
Jade  O
durian  O
mooncake  O
,  O
especially  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
100  O
%  O
pure  O
top  O
grade  O
Mao  O
Shan  O

The  O
strong  O
durian  O
aroma  O
filled  O
the  O
air  O
onceI  O
sliced  O
the  O
mooncake  O
.  O

The  O
durian  O
filling  O
was  O
very  O
rich  O
and  O
nice  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
pandan  O
snowskin  O
was  O
a  O
bad  O
combination  O
which  O
spoilt  O
the  O
richness  O
taste  O
of  O
the  O
durian  O
filling  O
.  O

Think  O
Fast  O
Food  O
is  O
junk  O
food  O
?  O

Think  O
again  O
.  O

This  O
phrase  O

on  O
the  O
wall  O
of  O
the  O
new  O

Yes  O

vegetarian  O
burgers  O
,  O
buns  O

wholemeal  O
organic  O
grains  O

that  O
are  O
free  O
of  O

and  O
genetically  O

.  O

Currently  O
,  O
VeganBurgoffers  O
5  O
different  O
type  O
of  O
burgers  O
namely  O
,  O
Cracked  O
Pepper  O
Mayo  O
,  O
Hawaiian  O
Pineapple  O
,  O
Smoky  O
BBQ  O
,  O
Char-Grilled  O
Satay  O
and  O
Tangy  O

which  O
were  O
designed  O
to  O
provide  O
different  O
nutrients  O
.  O

Sample  O
of  O
the  O
menu  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Cracked  O
Pepper  O
Mayo  O
meal  O
(  O
which  O
contains  O
Omega  O
3  O
,  O
Omega  O
6  O
,  O
Zinc  O
)  O
while  O
my  O
partner  O
ordered  O
the  O
Smoky  O
BBQ  O
meal  O
(  O
which  O
contains  O
Beta-Carotene  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
mealalso  O
included  O
fries  O
and  O
juice  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
,  O
the  O
burgers  O
tasted  O
very  O
yummy  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
way  O
beyond  O
my  O
expectation  O
for  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
burger  O
.  O

The  O
cracked  O
pepper  O
mayo  O
patty  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
soya  O
flavour  O
while  O
the  O
smoky  O
BBQ  O
patty  O
had  O
a  O
mushroomy  O
flavour  O
.  O

Being  O
a  O
meat  O
person  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
I  O
may  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
``  O
filling  O
''  O
satisfaction  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
wrong  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
full  O
and  O
satisfied  O
after  O
the  O
meal  O

I  O
mentioned  O
relaunched  O
because  O
I  O

there  O
was  O
Texas  O
Chicken  O
in  O
the  O
1980  O

if  O
my  O
memories  O
were  O
correct  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
thanks  O
to  O
Select  O

,  O
they  O
have  O
brought  O
Texas  O

the  O

chains  O
,  O
the  O
fried  O
chicken  O
at  O
Texas  O
Chicken  O
was  O
less  O
oily  O
.  O

HoweverI  O
thought  O
the  O
chicken  O
lacked  O
the  O
fragrance  O
in  O
their  O
seasoning  O
.  O

The  O
biscuit  O
was  O
nice  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
theirs  O
to  O
Popeye  O

Their  O

After  O

a  O

bit  O
about  O
this  O

place  O
,  O
I  O
took  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
visit  O
this  O
place  O
by  O
suggesting  O
to  O
my  O
colleague  O
for  O
her  O
farewell  O
dinner  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
not  O
easy  O
to  O
locate  O
this  O
place  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
on  O
the  O
main  O
road  O
.  O

After  O
you  O
alightat  O
the  O
bus  O
stop  O
,  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
walk  O
further  O
down  O

turn  O
into  O

you  O
are  O

We  O
ordered  O
the  O
Wasuga  O

Initially  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
some  O
Japanese  O
marinated  O
chicken  O
wings  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
realized  O
it  O
meant  O
``  O
Wa  O

''  O
(  O
in  O
dialect  O
)  O
meaning  O
``  O
I  O

The  O

reduce  O

The  O
last  O
time  O
I  O
tried  O
7th  O
Storey  O
was  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
old  O
Bugis  O
premise  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
it  O
has  O
now  O
moved  O
to  O
Purvis  O
Street  O
and  O
a  O
new  O
restaurant  O
has  O
also  O
opened  O
up  O
at  O
Marina  O
Barrage  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprised  O
to  O
find  O
7th  O
Storey  O
at  O
IMM  O
so  O
myfriends  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

It  O
basically  O
offers  O
both  O
steamboat  O
and  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
.  O

We  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
traditional  O
steamboat  O
set  O
$  O
8.90  O

person  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
alsobeef  O

set  O
at  O

9.90  O
and  O

set  O
at  O

of  O
the  O
charcoal  O
style  O
steamboat  O
,  O
it  O
used  O
mini  O
gas  O
style  O
steamboat  O
here  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
broth  O
which  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
rice  O
was  O
very  O
fragrant  O
too  O

Intended  O
to  O
introduce  O
my  O
friend  O
to  O
the  O
new  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

It  O
seemed  O
like  O
the  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
was  O
over  O
baked  O
and  O
the  O
pasta  O
was  O
dry  O
with  O
very  O
little  O
sauce  O
.  O

Some  O
burnt  O
marks  O
could  O
be  O
seen  O
on  O
the  O
parchment  O
paper  O
suggesting  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
over  O
baked  O
.  O

Fortunately  O
the  O
spicy  O
chicken  O
pomodoro  O
and  O
drumlets  O
turned  O
out  O
fine  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
hot  O
.  O

Hopefully  O
their  O
standard  O
can  O
be  O
more  O
consistent  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O

I  O
was  O
away  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
one  O
week  O
in  O
Melbourne  O
for  O
work  O
.  O

Located  O
just  O
opposite  O
my  O
apartment  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
newly  O
opened  O

(  O
was  O
not  O
there  O
when  O
I  O
was  O
in  O
Melbourne  O
last  O
year  O
)  O
.  O

Unlike  O
the  O
Nando  O
's  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
you  O
need  O
to  O
order  O
your  O
meal  O
from  O
the  O
counter  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
then  O
given  O
a  O

my  O
food  O
was  O
served  O
to  O
me  O

the  O

an  O

it  O

It  O
wasmy  O
off  O
day  O
so  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
Marina  O
Bay  O
Sands  O
Sky  O
Park  O
with  O
my  O
friend  O
.  O

Indeed  O
the  O
view  O
at  O
the  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
Sky  O
Park  O
was  O
magnificent  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
at  O

,  O
it  O
was  O

it  O

there  O

a  O

a  O

Anyway  O
after  O
walking  O
around  O
,  O
I  O
settled  O
at  O
Jin  O
Shan  O

a  O
chinese  O
restaurant  O
that  O
offered  O

for  O

6  O

some  O
sections  O
were  O

and  O
a  O

have  O

.  O

One  O

them  O
is  O

It  O
has  O

ages  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
ate  O
at  O
Pizza  O
Hut  O
.  O

Thereare  O
a  O
lot  O
more  O
varieties  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O

not  O
only  O
pizza  O
but  O
pasta  O
,  O
baked  O
rice  O
,  O
salads  O
and  O
desserts  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
my  O
colleagues  O
and  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
told  O
that  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
20  O
minutes  O
for  O
the  O
parchment  O
pasta  O
so  O
we  O
ordered  O
their  O
hut  O
platter  O
appetiser  O
as  O
we  O
were  O
quite  O
hungry  O
.  O

The  O
hut  O
platter  O
came  O
with  O
fries  O
,  O
calamari  O
,  O
drumlets  O
and  O
scallop  O
rolls  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
food  O
standard  O
.  O

The  O
seasoning  O
for  O
the  O
drumlets  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
serving  O
were  O
quite  O
generous  O
for  O
both  O
parchment  O

.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
spicy  O

asthe  O

a  O
stronger  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O

would  O
be  O
better  O
if  O
the  O
sauce  O
was  O
more  O
creamy  O

the  O

of  O
a  O

of  O

the  O

The  O

slipped  O
off  O
the  O

easily  O
.  O

The  O
mashed  O
potato  O
and  O

are  O
very  O

too  O
.  O

The  O
mashed  O

was  O
not  O
dry  O
,  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
and  O
it  O
came  O
with  O
potato  O
skins  O
which  O
was  O
quite  O
unique  O
.  O

The  O
coleslaw  O
was  O
also  O
very  O
refreshing  O
and  O
nice  O
which  O
different  O
from  O
what  O
we  O
usually  O
get  O
elsewhere  O

The  O

that  O
this  O

not  O

and  O
some  O

the  O

still  O
operating  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
second  O

and  O
settled  O
for  O
the  O
claypot  O
chicken  O

and  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O

.  O

The  O
claypot  O

was  O
cooked  O
over  O

so  O
there  O
will  O
be  O

Since  O
the  O
queue  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
long  O
,  O
I  O
bought  O
a  O
box  O
of  O
3  O

to  O
try  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
feeling  O
a  O

regret  O
when  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
staff  O
frying  O
the  O
takoyaki  O
in  O
the  O
pan  O
mold  O
filled  O
with  O
oil.I  O
was  O
taken  O
back  O
by  O
how  O
much  O
oil  O
he  O
was  O
using  O
.  O

Not  O
sure  O
whether  O
thisis  O
their  O
unique  O
way  O
of  O
preparing  O
the  O
takoyaki  O
but  O
it  O
turned  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
quite  O
nice  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
oily  O
.  O

In  O
fact  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
takoyaki  O
a  O
better  O
texture  O

I  O
got  O

from  O

In  O

,  O
they  O

another  O

,  O
the  O

I  O

it  O

that  O

wait  O
beside  O
your  O

Recently  O
the  O
restaurants  O
at  O
Sunset  O
Way  O
were  O
featured  O
in  O
theSunday  O
Times.Some  O
restaurants  O
may  O
call  O
it  O
a  O
day  O
after  O
being  O
asked  O
to  O
renew  O
tenancies  O
at  O
higher  O
rents  O
up  O
to  O
80  O
%  O
more  O
.  O

The  O
restaurants  O
are  O
still  O
in  O
negotiation  O
with  O
the  O
tenant  O
and  O
hopefully  O
they  O
are  O
not  O
forced  O
to  O
close  O
their  O
business  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
just  O
in  O
case  O
the  O
restaurants  O
decided  O
to  O
desert  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
was  O
very  O
vibrant  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
restaurants  O
were  O
crowded  O
.  O

I  O
settled  O

2  O
of  O
us  O
,  O
we  O
could  O
not  O
try  O
all  O
the  O

.  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
say  O
it  O

authentic  O

I  O
was  O
a  O

I  O

that  O
the  O

was  O
quite  O
normal  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
eaten  O
better  O

The  O

had  O
a  O

After  O
doing  O
some  O
research  O
on  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
I  O
realiseditused  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
Zi  O
Char  O
stall  O
in  O
Marine  O

before  O
it  O
shifted  O
to  O
the  O

in  O

The  O
Crab  O

very  O
good  O

Thebee  O

the  O
crab  O
flavour  O
very  O
well  O
.  O

The  O
crabs  O
were  O
excellent  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
pincers  O
are  O

the  O
meat  O
is  O
full  O
but  O
at  O
a  O
cost  O
of  O
$  O
45  O

The  O

I  O
have  O
to  O

I  O
was  O
not  O

much  O

was  O

The  O

me  O

was  O

too  O
.  O

The  O

meat  O
was  O

and  O
the  O

was  O
an  O

for  O
the  O

meat  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
a  O

with  O
the  O

have  O
more  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
was  O
not  O
expecting  O
much  O
from  O

restaurant.I  O
was  O
in  O
for  O
a  O

was  O
good  O
and  O
of  O

.  O

The  O
Buddha  O
Jump  O

impressed  O
me  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

The  O
ingredients  O
were  O
well  O
stewed  O
and  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O

was  O
an  O
excellent  O
combination  O
for  O
the  O

meat  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
with  O
the  O
lobster  O

which  O
should  O
have  O
more  O

.  O
