If  O
you  O
have  O
been  O
to  O
Vietnam  O
,  O
you  O
would  O
probably  O
heard  O
of  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
and  O
dine  O
there.I  O
used  O
to  O
travel  O
quite  O
a  O
bit  O
to  O
Ho  O
Chi  O
Minh  O
City  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
back  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
which  O
brings  O
to  O
the  O
table  O
authentic  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
at  O
a  O
relax  O
comtempoary  O
ambience  O
.  O

A  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
checking  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
Star  O
Vista  O
Mall  O
at  O
Buona  O
Vista  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
deciding  O
where  O
to  O
have  O
lunch  O
when  O
I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
someone  O
has  O
brought  O
the  O
restaurant  O
to  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Without  O
a  O
doubt  O
,  O
my  O
lunch  O
was  O
decided  O
.  O

Pho  O
Beef  O

Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
and  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
4.2/5  O

Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
is  O
all  O
about  O
fresh  O
vegetables  O
&  O
herbs  O
,  O
rice  O
paper  O
roll  O
and  O
fish  O
sauce  O
.  O

After  O
2  O
years  O
of  O
research  O
before  O
they  O
opened  O
their  O
first  O
restaurant  O
Feb  O
2006  O
in  O
Vietnam  O
,  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
not  O
only  O
brings  O
the  O
4  O
key  O
elements  O
of  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
to  O
the  O
table  O
but  O
also  O
the  O
different  O
styles  O
of  O
North  O
,  O
Central  O
and  O
South  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisines  O
.  O

Therollsare  O
the  O
star  O
of  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
Singapore  O
outlet  O
seems  O
to  O
have  O
lesser  O
varieties  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Vietnam  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Taste  O
of  O
Hanoi  O
(  O
North  O
Vietnam  O
)  O
rolls  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
.I  O
preferred  O
the  O
fresh  O
vegetables  O
and  O
herbs  O
of  O
the  O
Pho  O
Beef  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
to  O
the  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
latter  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
stuffing  O
and  O
pork  O
floss  O
on  O
top  O
resembles  O
those  O
Chee  O

have  O

Grilled  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
Rice  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Pudding  O
3.8/5  O

My  O
partner  O
was  O
famished  O
so  O
she  O
ordered  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
Rice  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
pork  O
was  O
beautifully  O
marinated  O
and  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
dry  O
to  O
our  O
likings  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
loved  O
thesalted  O
egg  O
pudding  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
's  O
meatball  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
also  O
chye  O
poh  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Vietnamese  O
Fish  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
something  O
light  O
as  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
heavy  O
breakfast  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Fish  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
15.90  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
called  O
it  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Yong  O
Tau  O
Foo  O
.  O

Therewere  O
ingredients  O
stuffed  O
with  O
fish  O
pastes  O
,  O
fish  O
balls  O
,  O
fish  O
slices  O
and  O
vegetables  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Vietnamese  O
rice  O
vermicelli  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
silky  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
delectable  O
with  O
the  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
soup  O
.  O

Here  O
is  O

while  O
we  O

for  O

The  O
bun  O
was  O
sugar  O
glazed  O
and  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
spongy  O
and  O
soft  O
like  O
cotton  O
.  O

It  O
felt  O
like  O
my  O
teeth  O
sunk  O

Sauce  O
Crab  O
4.2/5  O

Chef  O
Yong  O
wanted  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
crab  O
dish  O
that  O
is  O
distinctively  O
Singapore  O
when  O
he  O
opened  O
Majestic  O
Bay  O
.  O

With  O
his  O
love  O
for  O
coffee  O
and  O
a  O
good  O
3  O
months  O
of  O
research  O
,  O
the  O
Bay  O

Signature  O
``  O

Sauce  O
Crab  O
(  O

)  O
is  O
born  O
.  O

The  O
special  O
coffee  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
blend  O
of  O
3  O
different  O
coffee  O
beans  O
.  O

Apple  O
jam  O
was  O
also  O
added  O
to  O

it  O
.  O

Chinese  O
white  O
wine  O
is  O
poured  O
onto  O
the  O
crab  O
and  O
ignited  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
filling  O
the  O
restaurant  O
with  O
the  O
strong  O
coffee  O
aroma  O
.  O

This  O
probably  O
will  O
be  O
the  O
next  O
iconic  O
crab  O
dish  O
after  O
the  O
chilli  O
crab  O
,  O
black  O

Another  O

(  O

Served  O

was  O
first  O
fried  O
before  O
baking  O
in  O
cheese  O

A  O
fusion  O
dish  O
with  O
the  O
abundance  O
of  O
fresh  O
sea  O
treasures  O
and  O
the  O
bold  O
robust  O

got  O
the  O

Dessert  O
was  O
Sweet  O
Temptation  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
for  O
4  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
sweet  O

desserts  O
were  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
I  O
ca  O
n't  O
decide  O
which  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
probably  O
is  O
the  O
more  O
uncommon  O
among  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
dumping  O
comes  O
with  O
yam  O
paste  O
filling  O
.  O

It  O
is  O

Back  O
in  O
October  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
attended  O
the  O
monthly  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
which  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Forture  O
Seafood  O
Steamboat  O
along  O
Bukit  O
Timah  O
Road  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
a  O
few  O
of  O
the  O
regulars  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
2nd  O
time  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
is  O
held  O
here  O
because  O
the  O
former  O
chef  O
(  O
Ah  O
Loy  O
)  O
has  O
returned  O
to  O
helm  O
the  O
kitchen  O
again  O
.  O

Supreme  O
Dragon  O
&  O
Phoenix  O
Platter  O
4/5  O

The  O
dinner  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Supreme  O
Dragon  O
&  O
Phoenix  O
Platter  O
.  O

When  O
this  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
everyone  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
was  O
fascinated  O
by  O
the  O
colourful  O
pink  O
and  O
purple  O
sauces  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
they  O
were  O
strawberry  O
(  O
pink  O
)  O
and  O
dragon  O
fruit  O
(  O
purple  O
)  O
sauces  O
for  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
prawn  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
chicken  O
on  O
the  O
hand  O
was  O
dressed  O
in  O
a  O
lime  O
and  O
lemon  O
sauce  O
topped  O
with  O
sesame  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Fresh  O
Mushroom  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Fresh  O
Mushroom  O
was  O
nicely  O
executed  O
bringing  O
out  O
the  O
nature  O
earthy  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
fresh  O
mushroom  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Garoupa  O
in  O
Green  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
4/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Garoupa  O
in  O
Green  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
was  O
a  O
welcoming  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
cooking  O
styles  O
for  O
steamed  O
fish  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
steamed  O
perfectly  O
to  O
tender  O
soft  O
and  O
the  O
accompanying  O
green  O
curry  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
appetising  O
.  O

Stir-Fried  O
Vegetable  O
with  O
Dried  O
Scallops  O
3/5  O

The  O
Stir-Fried  O
Vegetable  O
with  O
Dried  O
Scallops  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
encountered  O
the  O
Qing  O
Long  O
Cai  O
literally  O
translated  O
as  O
Green  O
Dragon  O
Vegetable  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
chives  O
but  O
does  O
not  O
taste  O
like  O
it  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
toughness  O
of  O
the  O
dried  O
scallop  O
was  O
a  O
great  O
disappointment  O
which  O
was  O
the  O
downfall  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Salted  O
Baked  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
comforting  O
kampong  O
styleSalted  O
Baked  O
Chicken  O
was  O
delightful  O
addition  O
to  O
the  O
dinner  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
minced  O
sand  O
ginger  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
has  O
specially  O
imported  O
them  O
from  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

Our  O
table  O
was  O
raving  O
about  O
the  O
sauce  O
and  O
the  O
chef  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
give  O
us  O
some  O
to  O
bring  O
home  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Duck  O
Roll  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Duck  O
Roll  O
was  O
inspired  O
by  O
the  O
popular  O
Beijing  O
Duck  O
.  O

The  O
succulentduck  O
sandwiched  O
between  O
2  O
thin  O
layers  O
of  O
pancake  O
skin  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
twist  O
by  O
the  O
chef  O
.  O

Braised  O
Herbal  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
4/5  O

The  O
Braised  O
Herbal  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
was  O
huge  O
!  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
herbally  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
not  O
overpowering  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
4/5  O

Which  O
Zi  O
Cha  O
place  O
prepares  O
the  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
this  O
way  O
?  O

I  O
assume  O
ittakes  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
to  O
fry  O
the  O
hor  O
fun  O
to  O
such  O
a  O
beautiful  O
crisp  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
served  O
together  O
with  O
seafood  O
such  O
as  O
scallops  O
,  O
fish  O
maw  O
and  O
sea  O
cucumberwas  O
is  O
definitely  O
something  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
norm  O
and  O
worth  O
trying  O
.  O

Japanese  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
4/5  O

Wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
night  O
,  O
we  O
ended  O
our  O
dinner  O
with  O
a  O
Japanese  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
with  O
sago  O
dessert  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
Zi  O
Char  O
place  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
Forture  O
Seafood  O
Steamboat  O
is  O
a  O
notch  O
better  O
than  O
most  O
with  O
their  O
creativity  O
and  O
bold  O

in  O
their  O
dishes  O
.  O

For  O
inform  O
,  O
this  O
place  O
is  O
formally  O
known  O
as  O
Fortune  O
Seafood  O
.  O

They  O
dropped  O
the  O
``  O
N  O
''  O
and  O
replaced  O
it  O
with  O
``  O
R  O
''  O
after  O
fengshui  O
master  O
suggested  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
better  O
for  O
their  O
business  O

At  O

I  O
simply  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
with  O
the  O

Back  O
in  O
September  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
a  O
5  O
days  O
trip  O
to  O
Taipei  O
seizing  O
on  O
a  O
1  O
for  O
1  O
Jetstar  O
air  O
ticket  O
promotion  O
.  O

Since  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
to  O
Taipei  O
a  O
couple  O
times  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
train  O
ride  O
down  O
to  O
Hualien  O
to  O
stay  O
at  O
Bayview  O
Hotel  O
(  O
)  O
after  O
seeing  O
all  O
the  O
beautiful  O
photos  O
on  O
my  O
friend  O
's  O
facebook  O
page  O
.  O

Upon  O
our  O
arrival  O
at  O
Hualien  O
train  O
station  O
,  O
the  O
hotel  O
staff  O
picked  O
us  O
up  O
together  O
with  O
another  O
Singaporean  O
couple  O
.  O

The  O
journey  O
from  O
the  O
train  O
station  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
took  O
about  O
10  O
minutes  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
were  O
still  O
early  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
,  O
we  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
's  O
cafe  O
next  O
door  O
to  O
rest  O
and  O
wait  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
explore  O
the  O
area  O
as  O
we  O
were  O
tiredafter  O
a  O
long  O
journey  O
travelling  O
on  O
plane  O
,  O
train  O
and  O
car  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
cafe  O
,  O
it  O
felt  O
as  O
if  O
I  O
am  O
in  O
Greece  O
.  O

Helping  O
ourselves  O
to  O
the  O
free  O
beverage  O
and  O
local  O
snacks  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
our  O

our  O

is  O
fully  O

the  O

was  O
very  O

went  O

along  O
the  O
coastal  O

Along  O

The  O

There  O

a  O

when  O
I  O
arrived  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
at  O
about  O
145pm  O

I  O

After  O
reading  O
reviews  O
about  O
the  O
wasabi  O
broth  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Green  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
Special  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
toppings  O
(  O
seaweed  O
&  O
flavoured  O
egg  O
)  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
also  O
choose  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
soup  O
(  O
light/normal/strong  O
)  O
,  O
chicken  O
oil  O
(  O

)  O
and  O
texture  O
of  O
noodle  O
(  O
hard/normal/soft  O
)  O
during  O
your  O
order  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
ingredients  O
(  O
spring  O
onion/deep  O
fried  O
onion/black  O
fungus  O
)  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
want  O
the  O
chef  O
to  O
add  O
into  O
your  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
.  O

Resting  O
on  O
the  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
was  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
wasabi  O
.  O

Mixing  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
chicken  O
broth  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
broth  O
an  O
unique  O
delectable  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
mild  O
wasabi  O
spiciness  O
.  O

The  O
tamago  O
egg  O
was  O
well  O
flavoured  O
and  O
not  O
too  O
salty  O
.  O

Black  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
Special  O
4.2/5  O

Each  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
comes  O
with  O
the  O
standard  O
gigantic  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
is  O
defintiely  O
the  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
toasted  O
szechuan  O
peppercorn  O
and  O
garlic  O
in  O
oil  O
that  O
gave  O
the  O
chicken  O
broth  O
the  O
fragrant  O
toasty  O
aroma  O
.  O

Having  O
tried  O
both  O
Marutama  O
Ramen  O
and  O
Marukin  O
Ramen  O
Tokyo  O
that  O
used  O
chicken  O
stock  O
for  O
their  O
ramen  O
,  O
I  O
think  O
Chef  O
Keisuke  O
Takeda  O
nailed  O
his  O
version  O
.  O

While  O
chicken  O
stock  O
ramen  O
is  O
less  O
oily  O
and  O
lighter  O
,  O
Keisuke  O
Tori  O
King  O
's  O
broth  O
ismore  O
robust  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
generous  O
servicing  O
of  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
definitely  O
is  O
a  O
crowd  O
winner  O

.  O

Kkhongdon  O
in  O
Korean  O
literally  O
means  O
best  O
price  O
value  O
.  O

The  O
history  O
started  O
back  O
with  O
the  O
first  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Sinchon  O
,  O
Seoul  O
in  O
January  O
2005  O
.  O

To  O
date  O
there  O
are  O
67  O
outlets  O
in  O
Korea  O
providing  O
high  O
quality  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
at  O
reasonable  O
price  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
nicely  O
spaced  O
withextendable  O
air  O
suction  O
pipe  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
an  O
air  O
purifier  O
placed  O
in  O
corner  O
to  O
freshen  O
the  O
air  O
in  O
the  O
restaurantso  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
smell  O
like  O
BBQ  O
after  O
dining  O
.  O

Free  O
flow  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Korean  O
side  O
dishes  O
are  O
available  O
at  O
the  O
buffet  O
counter  O
but  O
rather  O
limited  O
selections  O
.  O

Aaron  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
cooked  O
us  O
some  O
kimchi  O
and  O
bean  O
sprouts  O
saying  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
warm  O
.  O

Indeed  O
it  O
did  O
and  O
I  O
will  O
do  O
so  O
when  O
I  O
next  O
visit  O
another  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Raspberry  O
Rice  O
Wine  O
3/5  O

As  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
something  O
different  O
on  O
the  O
beverage  O
menu  O
,  O
Aaron  O
recommended  O
me  O
the  O
Raspberry  O
Rice  O
Wine  O
360ml  O
(  O
$  O
19  O
)  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
should  O
have  O
just  O
stick  O
to  O
my  O
beer  O
.  O

Beef  O
Skirt  O
4/5  O

Beef  O
Fingers  O
4/5  O

On  O
the  O
beef  O
menu  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
both  O
the  O
Beef  O
Skirt  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
and  O
Beef  O
Fingers  O
(  O
$  O
16  O

.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
directly  O
imported  O
from  O
JP  O
Pepperdine  O
's  O
own  O
Silver  O
FernFarmsin  O
New  O

.  O

These  O
are  O
the  O
same  O
beefused  O
for  O
Jack  O
Place  O

steak  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Pork  O
Belly  O
4/5  O

Knowing  O
my  O
weakest  O
for  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
always  O
prefer  O
them  O
over  O
the  O
beef  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
fat  O
and  O
meat  O
when  O
grilled  O
were  O
simply  O
sizzling  O
yummy  O
.  O

Spicy  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
4/5  O

They  O

spicy  O

too  O
.  O

The  O
Spicy  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
just  O
as  O
good  O
but  O
it  O
wasa  O
bit  O
too  O
mild  O
in  O
the  O
spices  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
get  O
the  O
hot  O
rush  O
I  O
was  O
expecting  O
.  O

it  O
was  O
not  O
served  O
in  O

,  O
each  O

with  O
tasty  O
pork  O
belly  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
in  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
spicy  O
broth  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
tender  O
pork  O
belly  O
,  O
the  O
hotpot  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
soft  O
and  O
silky  O
tofu  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Egg  O
4/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
quite  O
flavourful  O
with  O
custard  O
like  O
texture  O
topped  O
with  O
scallions  O
and  O
carrots  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
tellwhat  O
's  O
the  O
broth  O
used  O
to  O
thin  O
the  O
egg  O
mixture  O
but  O
it  O
definitely  O
lifted  O
the  O
taste  O
and  O
dimension  O
of  O
this  O
humble  O
dish  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
think  O
Kkongdon  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
is  O
worth  O
a  O
visit  O
with  O
good  O
quality  O
meat  O
.  O

On  O
top  O
of  O
that  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
good  O
selection  O
of  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
.  O

It  O
would  O
be  O
nice  O
if  O
they  O
can  O
expand  O
the  O
selection  O
of  O
free  O
flow  O
kimchi  O
and  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
left  O
the  O
restaurant  O
smelling  O
of  O
BBQ  O
so  O
it  O
probably  O
need  O
to  O
install  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
air  O
purifiers  O

Reflectingon  O
the  O
Makan  O
Gathering  O
on  O
03  O
November  O
2012  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
an  O
event  O
that  O
was  O
filled  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
different  O
emotions  O
.  O

Both  O
Maureen  O
and  O
me  O
were  O
so  O
stress  O
leading  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
event  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
sleepless  O
nights  O
and  O
kept  O
askingeach  O
otherwhether  O
we  O
will  O
ever  O
do  O
it  O
again  O
?  O

I  O
will  O
leave  O
the  O
answer  O
to  O
the  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
post  O
cause  O
we  O
ourselves  O
said  O
this  O
to  O
each  O
other  O
,  O
``  O
ask  O
me  O
again  O
after  O
the  O
event  O
''  O
.  O

Those  O
that  O
follow  O
our  O
blogs  O
will  O
know  O
that  O
we  O
organised  O
regular  O
makan  O
trails  O
and  O
the  O
latest  O
was  O
a  O
hawker  O
trail  O
to  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Market  O
and  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Usually  O
these  O
makan  O
gatherings  O
were  O
kept  O
to  O
a  O
closely  O
knitted  O
group  O
of  O
friends  O
and  O
a  O
manageable  O
size  O
of  O
20-30  O
pax  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
for  O
this  O
makan  O
gathering  O
,  O
we  O
made  O
a  O
brave  O
decision  O
to  O
open  O
it  O
up  O
to  O
EVERYONE  O
.  O

Through  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
tasting  O
sessions  O
,  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
know  O
Kennie  O
from  O
High  O
Societyand  O
we  O
thought  O
maybe  O
we  O
can  O
do  O
a  O
sit  O
down  O
dinner  O
instead  O
of  O
the  O
usual  O
hawker  O
trails  O
.  O

Kennie  O
was  O
very  O
receptive  O
and  O
supportive  O
of  O
our  O
idea  O
and  O
a  O
menu  O
was  O
soon  O
drawn  O
upfora  O
fix  O
price  O
of  O
$  O
35  O
per  O
pax  O
.  O

The  O
initial  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
limit  O
the  O
makan  O
gathering  O
to  O
40  O
pax  O
but  O
as  O
we  O
sent  O
out  O
the  O
invites  O
on  O
facebook  O
,  O
we  O
realized  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
so  O
many  O
wonderful  O
friends  O
along  O
our  O
blogging  O
journey  O
and  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
with  O
70+  O
pax  O
in  O
our  O
invitation  O
.  O

Very  O
soon50+  O

,  O
she  O

the  O
makan  O
gathering  O
at  O
High  O
Society  O
Mansion  O
on  O
03  O
November  O
2012  O
.  O

Worried  O
that  O
we  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
host  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
bring  O
in  O
sponsors  O
so  O
everyone  O
has  O
something  O
to  O
bring  O
backfor  O
coming  O
to  O
the  O
Makan  O
Gathering  O
.  O

We  O
are  O
very  O
thankfulto  O
Huiji  O
,  O
Gold  O
Kili  O
,  O
Frezfruita  O
,  O
Mouth  O
Restaurant  O
and  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Beach  O
Road  O
for  O
the  O
sponsorship  O
.  O

Thank  O
you  O
Faith  O
,  O
Daniel  O
and  O
Karen  O
too  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photo  O
above  O
,  O
these  O
were  O
the  O
boxes  O
of  O
goodies  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
transport  O
to  O
the  O
venue  O
.  O

The  O
honey  O
weights  O
1KG  O
and  O
there  O
were  O
60  O
bottles  O
=  O
60KG  O
!  O

These  O
could  O
not  O
be  O
possible  O
without  O
the  O
help  O
from  O
Sherie  O
,  O
Yancai  O
and  O
Chuan  O
Kai  O
.  O

Both  O
Maureen  O
and  O
me  O
came  O
out  O
from  O
out  O
own  O
pockets  O
to  O
get  O
the  O
paper  O
bag  O
for  O
the  O
goodies  O
as  O
we  O
could  O
not  O
find  O
sponsor  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

Each  O
bag  O
cost  O
us  O
$  O
1  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
spend  O
$  O
60  O
getting  O
them  O
.  O

The  O
worst  O
nightmare  O
was  O
the  O
paper  O
bag  O
could  O
not  O
hold  O
the  O
weight  O
of  O
the  O
goodies  O
and  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
have  O
a  O
few  O
broken  O
kaya  O
bottles  O
.  O

Thank  O
goodness  O
no  O
one  O
was  O
hurt  O
and  O
we  O
apologize  O
for  O
the  O
unfortunate  O
incident  O
.  O

High  O
Society  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
our  O
rescue  O
providing  O
us  O
with  O
another  O
50  O
plastic  O
bags  O
.  O

Thank  O
you  O
to  O
the  O
staff  O
for  O
cleaning  O
up  O
the  O
mess  O
too  O
.  O

Even  O
Maureen  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
aboutthis  O
as  O
I  O
composite  O
this  O
paragraph  O
.  O

Since  O
I  O
was  O
the  O
only  O
one  O
that  O
arrived  O
early  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
preparation  O
work  O
cause  O
she  O
was  O
held  O
up  O
by  O
traffic  O
transporting  O
the  O
goodies  O
,  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
meeting  O
with  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
on  O
the  O
flow  O
of  O
the  O
serve  O
and  O
how  O
we  O
can  O
help  O
the  O
kitchen  O
to  O
get  O
out  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
to  O
everyone  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
thank  O
Rae  O
,  O
Celes  O
and  O
Jiayi  O
who  O
came  O
early  O
and  O
helped  O
out  O
at  O
the  O
registration  O
.  O

They  O
played  O
a  O
major  O
role  O
intaking  O
each  O
individual  O
's  O
main  O
order  O
,  O
tallying  O
them  O
for  O
each  O
table  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
communicate  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
and  O
hence  O
the  O
kitchen  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
staffs  O
at  O
High  O
Society  O
for  O
getting  O
all  O
62  O
mains  O
out  O
to  O
everyone  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O
operations  O
flow  O
was  O
smooth  O
and  O
no  O
one  O
had  O
to  O
wait  O
long  O
for  O
their  O
food  O
.  O

Following  O
the  O
62  O
individual  O
mains  O

there  O
were  O
another  O

dishes  O
excluding  O

soups  O
!  O

My  O

at  O
High  O
Society  O
for  O
a  O

we  O

food  O
quality  O
,  O
we  O

straight  O
,  O
both  O
Maureen  O

not  O

.  O

We  O

our  O
own  O
meal  O
like  O
everyone  O
.  O

In  O
actual  O
fact  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
cover  O
the  O
cost  O
of  O
the  O
paper  O

as  O
well  O
as  O
a  O
misplaced  O
envelope  O
of  O
the  O

,  O
a  O

The  O
same  O
people  O
that  O
brings  O
you  O
Sogurt  O
has  O
ventured  O
into  O
a  O
new  O
savoury  O
concept  O
bringing  O
you  O
SOFRIES  O
at  O
the  O
newly  O
opened  O
Star  O
Vista  O
beside  O
Buona  O
Vista  O
MRT  O
station  O
.  O

Similar  O
toSogurt  O
's  O
concept  O
of  O
empowering  O
the  O
choices  O
to  O
the  O
customers  O
,  O
at  O
SOFRIES  O
you  O
get  O
to  O
select  O
the  O
type  O
of  O
fries  O
and  O
pair  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
many  O
dipping  O
sauces  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

On  O
their  O
menu  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
4  O
types  O
of  O

.  O

They  O
are  O
Straight  O

The  O
Cereal  O
Fries  O
was  O
the  O
most  O
interesting  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
anything  O
like  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
nothing  O
like  O
fries  O
yet  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
in  O
its  O
own  O
unique  O
taste  O
and  O
texture  O
.  O

Our  O
host  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
some  O
people  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
too  O
sweet  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
think  O
so  O
.  O

She  O
has  O

cook  O

her  O
next  O
time  O

Inspired  O
by  O

Paradise  O
,  O
I  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
in  O
using  O
kiwi  O
to  O
steam  O
fish  O
.  O

Use  O
only  O
green  O
kiwi  O
and  O
not  O
yellow  O
kiwi  O
,  O
also  O
choose  O
one  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
too  O
ripe  O
so  O
that  O
the  O
kiwi  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
too  O
mushy  O
after  O
steaming  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Fish  O
with  O
Green  O

enjoyed  O
the  O
taste  O

The  O

similar  O
to  O

)  O
plum  O
commonly  O
used  O
for  O

.  O

If  O
you  O
like  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
sour  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
a  O
few  O
slices  O
of  O
tomatoes  O
.  O

The  O
Mentai  O
Salmon  O
Takana  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
18.80  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
reverse  O
sushi  O
roll  O
with  O
the  O
Japanese  O

mustard  O

and  O
salmon  O
wrapping  O
around  O
the  O
spicy  O
seasoned  O
cod  O
roe  O
,  O
sweet  O
omelette  O
and  O
cucumber  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
both  O
in  O
visual  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
Japanese  O
preserved  O
mustard  O
leaf  O
also  O
gave  O
the  O
roll  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
.  O

MentaiCheese  O
Chigiri  O
Age  O
3/5  O

Initally  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
Mentai  O
Cheese  O
Chigiri  O
Age  O
(  O
$  O
9.80  O
)  O
was  O
chicken  O
bites  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
actually  O
fishcake  O
of  O
spicy  O
seasoned  O
cod  O
roe  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
something  O
I  O
would  O
not  O
usually  O
find  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
or  O
ordered  O
in  O
a  O
Japanese  O
restaurant  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
quite  O
pedestrian  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Gyoza  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Kurobuta  O
Gyoza  O

$  O
9.80  O
)  O
was  O
smaller  O
and  O
more  O
compact  O
with  O
its  O
filling  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
bite  O
size  O
Berkshire  O
pork  O
dumplings  O
was  O
filled  O
with  O
cabbage  O
,  O
chives  O
and  O
garlic  O
.  O

Even  O
though  O
the  O
gyoza  O
was  O
pan  O
fried  O
,  O
themeat  O
in  O
thefilling  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Probably  O
the  O
best  O
Gyoza  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

.  O

The  O
Shiokoji  O
Moriawase  O
(  O
$  O
15.80  O
)  O
was  O
an  O
eye  O
opener  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
demonstrated  O
how  O
by  O
controlling  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
shiokoji  O
can  O
bring  O
out  O
different  O
flavours  O
and  O
tastes  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
platter  O

something  O

The  O
Frog  O

is  O
my  O
favourite  O
among  O
all  O

of  O
the  O

It  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
thick  O

spicy  O
sauce  O
that  O
complements  O
the  O
Cantonese  O
style  O

very  O
well  O

not  O

well  O
as  O

while  O
the  O

are  O

while  O
friends  O
can  O
gather  O
for  O
some  O
tea  O

.  O

Chinese  O

is  O
generally  O
categorised  O
into  O
black  O

Basically  O

We  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
3  O
types  O
of  O
tea  O
namely  O
Silver  O
Tea  O

(  O

,  O
Imperial  O

(  O

.  O

Very  O
interestingly  O
,  O
each  O
tea  O
leaf  O
has  O
a  O
legendary  O
story  O
behind  O
it  O
.  O

Takefor  O
example  O
theDa  O
Hong  O
Pao  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
about  O
a  O
topscholar  O
who  O
protected  O
the  O
tea  O
tree  O
with  O
his  O
red  O
robe  O
in  O
a  O
stormy  O
night  O
.  O

He  O
was  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
temple  O
to  O
express  O
his  O
thanks  O
to  O
the  O
abbot  O
who  O
took  O
care  O
of  O
him  O
when  O
he  O
fell  O
sick  O
on  O
his  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
imperial  O
exam  O
.  O

The  O
abbot  O
brewed  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
tea  O
for  O
him  O
to  O
drink  O
and  O
he  O
soon  O
recovered  O
.  O

Eventually  O
took  O
his  O
exam  O
and  O
became  O
top  O
scholar  O
that  O
year  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
art  O
of  O
tea  O
brewing  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
also  O
learnt  O
about  O
postures  O
and  O
the  O
ways  O
of  O
hold  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
between  O
male  O
and  O
female  O
.  O

which  O
was  O

and  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
so  O
soft  O
that  O
it  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
.  O

The  O
unique  O
name  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
tendency  O
of  O
the  O
fish  O
turning  O
white  O
as  O
milk  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
cooked  O
and  O
its  O

We  O
were  O
told  O
that  O
the  O
fish  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
bones  O
and  O
usually  O
only  O

I  O
was  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Liang  O
Court  O
Shopping  O
Centre  O
with  O
my  O
girl  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
remaining  O
of  O
our  O
vouchers  O
after  O
the  O
Japan  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
at  O
Liang  O
Court  O
Shopping  O
Centre  O
.  O

We  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Shabu  O
No  O
Koya  O
since  O
we  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
other  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
order  O
the  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
and  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Shabu  O
Shabu  O
Set  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
the  O
restaurant  O
uses  O
large  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
to  O
hold  O
the  O
soup  O
.  O

These  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
is  O
from  O
Japan  O
and  O
absorbs  O
impurities  O
from  O
the  O
meat  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
amazing  O
that  O
the  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
can  O
stay  O
intact  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
boilng  O
and  O
cooking  O
.  O

Kurobuta  O
Pork  O

Wagyu  O
Beef  O

Both  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
and  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
were  O
beautiful  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
they  O
were  O
too  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
for  O
textural  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
rather  O
bland  O
but  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
vegetables  O
were  O
brought  O
to  O
a  O
boil  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
sweeten  O
.  O

Shabu  O
Shabu  O
4/5  O

The  O
lovely  O
and  O
hearty  O
dinner  O
however  O
was  O
spolit  O
by  O
some  O
unexpected  O
experience  O
.  O

First  O
of  O
all  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
rice  O
at  O
7pm  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
absurd  O
considermost  O
of  O
the  O
walk  O
in  O
customers  O
asked  O
for  O
rice  O
and  O
some  O
even  O
walked  O
away  O
when  O
told  O
no  O
more  O
rice  O
is  O
served  O
.  O

Why  O
ca  O
n't  O
they  O
cook  O
some  O
rice  O
since  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
early  O
from  O
closing  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
even  O
supermarket  O
just  O
down  O
the  O
corridor  O
.  O

We  O
could  O
see  O
that  O
a  O
few  O
customers  O
were  O
quite  O
upset  O
when  O
they  O
could  O
n't  O
have  O
another  O
refill  O
that  O
include  O
myself  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
have  O
a  O
little  O
commotion  O
who  O
I  O
think  O
is  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
.  O

She  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
discourage  O
us  O
from  O
using  O
the  O
voucher  O
although  O
they  O
participated  O
in  O
the  O
Japan  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
week  O
organised  O
by  O
the  O
shopping  O
centre  O
,  O
saying  O
it  O
is  O
hard  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
claim  O
from  O
the  O
mall  O
's  O
management  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
end  O
we  O
just  O
gave  O
her  O
the  O
vouchers  O
and  O
left  O
since  O
she  O
claimed  O
that  O
the  O
most  O
she  O
treated  O
it  O
as  O
if  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
free  O
meal  O

the  O
Group  O
's  O
first  O
artistic  O
restaurant  O
celebrates  O
its  O
10anniversary  O
this  O
year  O
.  O

While  O
waiting  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
bloggers  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
a  O
delectabe  O
trio  O
of  O
canapes  O
that  O
showcased  O
the  O
artistic  O
endeavour  O
reflected  O
in  O
My  O
Humble  O
House  O
's  O
cuisine  O
,  O
design  O
,  O
service  O
and  O
attention  O
to  O
detail  O
.  O

Popping  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Roll  O
canape  O
into  O
the  O
mouth  O
came  O
with  O
abundance  O
of  O
freshness  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
delectable  O
sauce  O
that  O
married  O
everything  O
together  O
.  O

Chicken  O
rice  O
as  O
a  O
canape  O
is  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
amazedthat  O
ourlocal  O
delicacy  O
can  O
be  O
presented  O
exquisitely  O
as  O
a  O
sushi  O
canape  O
.  O

The  O
canape  O
even  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
dash  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
that  O
completes  O
the  O
whole  O
meal  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
canape  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
amongthe  O
bloggers  O
.  O

The  O
balance  O
of  O
texture  O
and  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
XO  O
sauce  O
was  O
lovely  O
executed  O
.  O

Next  O
up  O
we  O
have  O
Senior  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
Ken  O
Ling  O
and  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
David  O
Liew  O
demonstrated  O
to  O
us  O
2  O
winning  O
dishes  O
at  O
this  O
year  O
Epicurean  O
Star  O
Award  O
.  O

Uniquely  O
TungLok  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
have  O
seen  O
and  O
triedBlack  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

The  O
first  O
dish  O
prepared  O
by  O
the  O
2  O
executive  O
chefs  O
was  O
Pan-seared  O
Maotai  O
Wine-marinated  O
Chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
wrapped  O
in  O
Black  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
,  O
chicken  O
breast  O
meat  O
paste  O
and  O
foie  O
gras  O
were  O
molded  O
into  O
a  O
rectangle  O
shape  O
before  O
being  O
pan-seared  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
then  O
placed  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
homemade  O
black  O
sesame  O
crepe  O
with  O
romaine  O
lettuce  O
,  O
cripsy  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
,  O
leek  O
,  O
ginger  O
flower  O
,  O
peanut  O
crumbs  O
,  O
black  O
sesame  O
and  O
mustard  O
glazed  O
suckling  O
pig  O
sauce  O
.  O

After  O
the  O
demonstration  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
giving  O
the  O
ingredients  O
to  O
plate  O
it  O
ourself  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Pan-seared  O
Maotai  O
Wine-marinated  O
Chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
wrapped  O
in  O
Black  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
who  O
does  O
not  O
take  O
foie  O
gras  O
commented  O
that  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
the  O
acquire  O
taste  O
and  O
she  O
was  O
happy  O
to  O
finish  O
everything  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
creativity  O
of  O
the  O
black  O
sesame  O
crepe  O
which  O
was  O
soft  O
,  O
smooth  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
secondwinning  O
dish  O
the  O
two  O
chefs  O
put  O
together  O
for  O
us  O
was  O
the  O
Soft  O
Red  O
Bean  O
Banana  O
Ball  O
coated  O
in  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
served  O
on  O
Chilled  O
Tropical  O
Fruits  O
with  O
Crushed  O
Coconut-flavoured  O
Ice  O
with  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
surprisingly  O
long  O
name  O
for  O
a  O
dish  O
considering  O
the  O
chinese  O
name  O
for  O
the  O
dish  O
only  O
has  O
7  O
characters  O
,  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
ball  O
or  O
rice  O
dumpling  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
of  O
the  O
coconut  O
husk  O
bowl  O
was  O
stuffed  O
with  O
banana  O
cubes  O
and  O
red  O
bean  O
paste  O
.  O

The  O
lovely  O
dessert  O
was  O
like  O
compact  O
coconut  O
platter  O
.  O

The  O
coconut  O
ice  O
cream  O
was  O
made  O
from  O
pure  O
coconut  O
juice  O
,  O
coconut  O
milk  O
,  O
pandan  O
leaf  O
and  O
sugar  O
bringing  O
it  O
to  O
a  O
boil  O
until  O
mixture  O
thicken  O
and  O
refrigerate  O
for  O
8  O
hours  O
.  O

The  O
coconut  O
flesh  O
was  O
also  O
deep  O
fry  O
to  O
crispy  O
to  O
give  O
texture.The  O
chef  O
also  O
painstakingly  O
removed  O
the  O
husk  O
making  O
it  O
into  O
a  O
bowl  O
so  O
customers  O
canenjoy  O
the  O
coconut  O
fresh  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
management  O
asked  O
me  O
whether  O
I  O
have  O
visited  O
My  O
Humble  O
House  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
bad  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
considering  O
it  O
is  O
into  O
its  O
10  O
anniversary  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
very  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
effort  O
behind  O
each  O
dish  O
and  O
the  O
artistic  O
presentation  O
of  O
them  O
.  O

Attention  O
to  O
details  O
were  O
also  O
put  O
into  O
each  O
dish  O
.  O

My  O
Humble  O

We  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Thai  O
Glass  O
Noodle  O
Salad  O
which  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
.  O

good  O
but  O
itwas  O
stilla  O

.  O

Thai  O
Papaya  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

Compared  O
to  O
the  O
glass  O
noodle  O
salad  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Papaya  O
Salad  O
was  O
more  O
flavoursome  O
and  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
fearsome  O
kick  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Like  O
the  O
glass  O
noodle  O
salad  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
them  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
dash  O
more  O
fish  O
sauce  O
and  O
lime  O
.  O

Cakes  O

A  O
common  O
street  O
food  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Fish  O
Cakes  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
by  O
the  O
kitchen  O
of  O
Plaza  O
Brasserie  O
.  O

The  O
lightly  O
breaded  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Thai  O
fish  O
cakes  O
with  O
its  O
outer  O
crisp  O
and  O
a  O
delightful  O
light  O
bites  O
.  O

Thai  O
Fish  O
Maw  O
Soup  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Thai  O
Fish  O
Maw  O
Soup  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
savoury  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
servedright  O
in  O
time  O
to  O
cool  O
off  O
my  O
palate  O
after  O
having  O
all  O
the  O
spicy  O
food  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
being  O
told  O
itwas  O
Thai  O
fish  O
maw  O
soup  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
reallypointoutthe  O
difference  O
between  O

Thai  O
Beef  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Thai  O
Beef  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
group  O
.  O

The  O
excellent  O
broth  O
was  O
accompanied  O
with  O
tender  O
beef  O
and  O
bouncy  O
beef  O
balls  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
thick  O
but  O
thin  O
rice  O
noodles  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O

about  O
the  O

,  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
was  O
the  O
Thai  O
Red  O
Duck  O
Curry  O
.  O

It  O
may  O
sound  O
weird  O
to  O
have  O
roast  O
duck  O
meat  O
in  O
Thai  O
red  O
curry  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
balanced  O
and  O
flavoursome  O
.  O

The  O

with  O
Basil  O
leaves  O
was  O
calling  O
out  O
for  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
fragrant  O
rice  O
.  O

Once  O
again  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
in  O
seasoning  O
and  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
watery  O

The  O
durian  O
paste  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
most  O

in  O
the  O
group  O
ended  O
up  O
having  O
the  O

Back  O
in  O
July  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
blogged  O
about  O
my  O
Japanese  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
at  O
Liang  O
Court  O
Shopping  O
Court  O
with  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
and  O
lovely  O
friends  O
(  O
Celes  O
,  O
Charlene  O
and  O
Zhihao  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
long  O
and  O
tiring  O
day  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
all  O
famished  O
by  O
dinner  O
time  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
n't  O
help  O
when  O
the  O
restaurants  O
we  O
wanted  O
to  O
visit  O
were  O
all  O
full  O
and  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
.  O

Cutting  O
the  O
story  O
short  O
,  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
dining  O
at  O
Nirai  O
Kanai  O
Okinawan  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
recently  O
watched  O
a  O
food  O
documentary  O
show  O
and  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
Okinawan  O
cuisine  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
influence  O
from  O
the  O
Chinese  O
and  O
Southeast  O
Asian  O
cuisines  O
due  O
to  O
trade  O
in  O
the  O
early  O
dates  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
difference  O
in  O
culture  O
,  O
climate  O
,  O
vegetables  O
and  O
other  O
ingredients  O
between  O
Okinawan  O
and  O
mainland  O
Japan  O
,  O
Okinawan  O
cuisine  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
mainland  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Crispy  O
River  O
Shrimp  O
4/5  O

We  O
started  O
with  O
some  O
bites  O
and  O
starters  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
our  O
mains  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
River  O
Shrimp  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
suggested  O
by  O
Zhihao  O
who  O
has  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

Really  O
interesting  O
crispy  O
bites  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
saltiness  O
.  O

Be  O
warned  O
to  O
be  O
careful  O
while  O
eating  O
these  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
not  O
careful  O
and  O
the  O
claw  O
got  O
stuck  O
into  O
my  O
gum  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
removing  O
it  O
.  O

Vinegared  O
Mozuku  O
Seaweed  O
3.8/5  O

Initially  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Green  O
Caviar  O
Seaweed  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Sea  O
Grapes  O
but  O
they  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
stock  O
that  O
day  O
.  O

Hence  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
having  O
the  O
Vinegared  O
Mozuku  O
Seaweed  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
seaweed  O
was  O
a  O
refreshing  O
starter  O
for  O
a  O
beautiful  O
meal  O
waiting  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

Pig  O
's  O
Ear  O
with  O

or  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
Pig  O
's  O
Ear  O
with  O
peanut  O
dressing  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
starters  O
among  O
the  O
three  O
.  O

The  O
delectable  O
dressing  O
accompanied  O
with  O
the  O
crutchy  O
texture  O
was  O
really  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Tebichi  O
,  O
Simmered  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
4/5  O

As  O
I  O
mentioned  O
we  O
were  O
famished  O
,  O
so  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
set  O
meal  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
our  O
individual  O
mains  O
plus  O
plain  O
rice  O
,  O
soup  O
,  O
vinegared  O
vege  O
dish  O
,  O
fried  O
meat  O
miso  O
andpeanut  O
beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Tebichi  O
,  O
Simmered  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
set  O
meal  O
(  O
$  O
17++  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
collagen  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
``  O
gelat  O
''  O
(  O
Malay  O
expression  O
to  O
denote  O
extreme  O
weariness  O
and  O
irritation  O
at  O
repetition  O
)  O
if  O
you  O
are  O
just  O
having  O
it  O
alone  O
without  O
other  O
sides  O
.  O

Rafute  O
,  O
Simmered  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Set  O
Meal  O
4.5/5  O

Charlene  O
and  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Rafute  O
,  O
Simmer  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
set  O
meal  O
(  O
$  O
17++  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
simply  O
``  O
oishii  O
''  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
has  O
the  O
influence  O
of  O
Chinese  O
cuisine  O
which  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
braised  O
pork  O
belly  O
.  O

Buta  O
Kimuchi  O
,  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
with  O

For  O
Southeast  O
Asian  O
influence  O
in  O
Okinawa  O
cuisine  O
,  O
we  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
Buta  O
Kumuchi  O
,  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
with  O
Kimchi  O
set  O
meal  O
(  O
$  O
15.30++  O

which  O
Zhihao  O
had  O
.  O

Gyu  O

Celes  O

the  O
only  O
one  O
in  O
the  O
group  O
that  O
did  O
not  O
order  O
pork  O
for  O

Soup  O
3/5  O

The  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
5.80  O
)  O
was  O
decent  O
but  O
not  O
awesome  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
really  O
taste  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O

was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
so  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
that  O
it  O
slipped  O
off  O
with  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
sauce  O
cutting  O
through  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
also  O
interesting  O
and  O
delightful  O
to  O

Unfortunately  O
our  O

The  O

a  O
nice  O
balance  O
of  O

The  O

Jumbo  O

Cocktail  O

A  O
hot  O
favourite  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
,  O
the  O
Jumbo  O
Prawn  O
Cocktail  O
(  O

used  O
fresh  O

homemade  O
cocktail  O
sauce  O
of  O

and  O
Worchester  O
sauce  O
.  O

Huge  O
for  O
me  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
the  O
best  O
,  O
the  O
jumbo  O
prawn  O
's  O
texture  O
was  O
firmer  O
and  O
tougher  O
than  O
norm  O
which  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
really  O
enjoy  O
.  O

Before  O
I  O
go  O
into  O
the  O
star  O
item  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
,  O
some  O
facts  O
from  O
the  O
butcher  O
's  O
block  O
.  O

Each  O
cut  O
of  O
steak  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
is  O
handpicked  O
,  O
cut  O
in-house  O
and  O
prepared  O
by  O
eperienced  O
hands  O
.  O

Each  O
slab  O
is  O
flavoured  O
with  O
seasoned  O
sea  O
salt  O
and  O
broiled  O
at  O
980  O
degrees  O
Celsius  O
inside  O
the  O

from  O

to  O
attain  O
the  O
ideal  O
medium-rare  O
doneness  O

The  O
150-day  O
grain-fed  O
,  O
wet-aged  O
Ribeye  O
Steak  O
(  O
12-ounce  O
$  O
74  O
)  O
definitely  O
was  O
the  O
brightest  O
star  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
exchanging  O
glance  O
with  O
Jacob  O
(  O
www.cooksnapeatlove.com  O
)  O
who  O
like  O
me  O
has  O
tried  O
the  O
Ribeye  O
at  O
Ruth  O
's  O
Chris  O
Steak  O
House  O
,  O
the  O
ribeye  O
steak  O
brought  O
a  O
smile  O
to  O
our  O
face  O
.  O

The  O
Ribeye  O
Steak  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
was  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Australian  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Tomahawk  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
70-day  O
grained-fed  O
,  O
wet-aged  O
,  O
young  O
Black  O
Angus  O
cut  O
is  O
thus  O
named  O
for  O
its  O
resemblance  O
to  O
a  O
Native  O
Amercian  O
Indian  O
battle  O
axe  O
or  O
tomahawk  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
looked  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
baseball  O
bat  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
how  O
gigantic  O
the  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Tomahawk  O
(  O
$  O
125  O
)  O
is  O
.  O

The  O
massive  O
whole  O
rib  O
steak  O
weights  O
a  O
good  O
1.1kg  O
to  O
1.3kg  O
with  O
bone  O
in  O
and  O
is  O
served  O
medium  O
rare  O
after  O
20  O
minutes  O
in  O
the  O
broiler  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
understand  O
the  O
difficulty  O
in  O
cooking  O
such  O
a  O
big  O
pieces  O
of  O
cut  O
.  O

The  O
doneness  O
was  O
rather  O
inconsistent  O
.  O

Since  O
the  O
huge  O
portion  O
is  O
meant  O
to  O
be  O
shared  O
,  O
maybe  O
it  O
will  O
satisfy  O
the  O
different  O
preference  O
of  O
doneness  O
for  O
the  O
table  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
weak  O
in  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
was  O
rather  O
chewy  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
ribeye  O
more  O
than  O
the  O
tomahawk  O
.  O

does  O

For  O
the  O
session  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
tried  O
3  O
of  O
their  O
signature  O
sides  O

They  O
were  O

and  O

(  O

My  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
Sauteed  O
Kiplfer  O
Potatoes  O
,  O
nicely  O
seasoned  O
,  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

Wooloomooloo  O

on  O

There  O
was  O

much  O
room  O
left  O
to  O
indulge  O
in  O
all  O
the  O
11  O
variety  O
of  O
desserts  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
I  O
still  O
got  O
my  O
sweet  O
fix  O
in  O
the  O
Pavlova  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
with  O
Chantilly  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
the  O

dessert  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O

The  O
Bread  O
and  O
Butter  O
Pudding  O
(  O

came  O
with  O
freshly  O
baked  O

,  O
pastry  O
cream  O
,  O
homemade  O
praline  O
and  O
a  O
scoop  O
of  O

.  O

A  O
lovely  O
dessert  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
night  O
with  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

Wooloomooloo  O
Steakhouse  O
has  O
an  O
inviting  O
,  O
relax  O
and  O
casual  O
ambience  O
although  O
it  O
is  O
labelled  O
as  O
a  O
premium  O
steakhouses  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
steak  O
which  O
I  O
understand  O
some  O
people  O
does  O
not  O
take  O
beef  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
offers  O
other  O
scrumptious  O
selection  O
including  O
specialities  O
such  O
as  O
Pan-Seared  O
Barramundi  O
Fillet  O
(  O

)  O
,  O
Grilled  O

and  O

Cutlets  O
(  O

.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
something  O
for  O
everyone  O
and  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
about  O
steak  O

and  O
stylish  O
surroundings  O
.  O

From  O
the  O
previous  O
Singapore  O
Restaurant  O
Week  O
,  O
we  O
understand  O
that  O
seats  O
at  O
these  O
fine  O
dining  O
and  O
middle-market  O
restaurants  O
are  O
greatly  O
sought  O
after  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
the  O
organisers  O
that  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
made  O
numerous  O
bookings  O
and  O
no  O
show  O
rate  O
is  O
the  O
highest  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
caused  O
inconvenience  O
to  O
the  O
restaurants  O
and  O
by  O
doing  O
that  O
you  O
may  O
unintentionally  O
took  O
up  O
the  O
seats  O
of  O
your  O
friend  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
courtesy  O
of  O
us  O
to  O
call  O
up  O
the  O
restaurant  O
if  O
we  O
ca  O
n't  O
make  O
it  O
.  O

In  O
doing  O
so  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
can  O
free  O
up  O
the  O
seats  O
for  O
others  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
upcoming  O
event  O
,  O
I  O
understand  O
DiningCity.com  O
will  O
implement  O
some  O
new  O
measures  O
to  O
lower  O
the  O
no  O
show  O
rate  O
.  O

On  O
top  O
of  O
that  O
,  O
they  O
will  O
also  O
update  O
on  O
their  O
twitter  O
account  O
(  O

Noodlestar  O

not  O
just  O

Fried  O
Silver  O

(  O

.  O

The  O
lightly  O
battered  O
crispiness  O
and  O
the  O
fatty  O
silver  O
fish  O
meat  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyable  O

resist  O
going  O
back  O

more  O

was  O
the  O

(  O

.  O

Hidden  O
underneath  O

a  O

eaten  O
alone  O
,  O
thesweetness  O
from  O
the  O

maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
overpowering  O
.  O

However  O
if  O
eaten  O
together  O
with  O
the  O

,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
disharefreshing  O

The  O

is  O
the  O

The  O

was  O
cooked  O

Steamed  O
Juicy  O
Meat  O
Dumpling  O
4.5/5  O

More  O
does  O
not  O
always  O
mean  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
tried  O
Xiao  O
Long  O
Bao  O
that  O
was  O
overly  O
chunky  O
with  O
their  O
fillings  O
thus  O
losing  O
that  O
balance  O
in  O
texture  O
and  O
flavours  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
pleasantly  O
surprised  O
that  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Juicy  O
Meat  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
or  O
Xiao  O
Long  O

at  O

rather  O
delicate  O
in  O

The  O
marriage  O
of  O
the  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Hot  O
&  O
Sour  O
sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
work  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
get  O
me  O
wrong  O
,  O
individually  O
the  O
dumpling  O
and  O
sauce  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
greatly  O
have  O
them  O
separately  O
but  O
they  O
are  O
just  O
not  O
compatible  O
with  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

Four  O
Season  O
Happiness  O
Dumpling  O
3.8/5  O

This  O

a  O

colours  O
.  O

The  O
Four  O
Season  O
Happiness  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
comes  O
in  O
4  O
colourful  O
fillings  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
broccoli  O
(  O
green  O
)  O
,  O
egg  O
yolk  O
(  O
yellow  O
)  O
,  O
black  O
fungus  O
(  O
black  O
)  O
and  O
ham  O
(  O
pink  O

.  O

Although  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
rather  O
mild  O
what  O
stood  O
out  O
was  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
.  O

After  O
trying  O
3  O
of  O
their  O
dumpling  O
dishes  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
thin  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
definitely  O
won  O
my  O
heart  O
.  O

praises  O

.  O

This  O
is  O
another  O

When  O
the  O

it  O
came  O
with  O
a  O

contains  O
a  O

that  O
it  O

The  O
beautiful  O

was  O
not  O

The  O

The  O
perfect  O
platter  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
local  O
fare  O
of  O
Thailand  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
of  O
the  O
tasting  O

was  O
the  O
'Miang  O
'  O
of  O
prawns  O
and  O
pomelo  O
on  O
betel  O
leaves  O
with  O
a  O
palm  O

.  O

This  O
a  O
very  O
unique  O
street  O
hawker  O
food  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
before  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
full  O
of  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
betel  O
leaves  O
were  O
grown  O
locally  O
at  O
the  O
back  O
of  O
the  O
kitchen  O

The  O
Green  O
Mango  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
9/  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
starter  O
for  O
me  O
whenever  O
I  O
visit  O
a  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
.  O

At  O
Sweet  O
Salty  O
Spicy  O
,  O
the  O
green  O
mango  O
salad  O
even  O
comes  O
with  O
crispy  O
salmon  O
topped  O
with  O
cashew  O
nuts  O
and  O
chilli  O
lime  O
dressing  O
.  O

The  O
salad  O
if  O
not  O
done  O
properly  O
can  O
be  O
toospicy  O
or  O
sourly  O
but  O
the  O
green  O
mango  O
salad  O
here  O
is  O
beautifully  O
balanced  O
.  O

Phat  O
Thai  O
4.5/5  O

Being  O
to  O
Thailand  O
numerous  O
time  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
have  O
not  O
come  O
across  O
a  O
restaurant  O
that  O
wok  O
up  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
authentic  O
Phat  O
Thai  O
.  O

Eventually  O
I  O
stopped  O
ordering  O
the  O
dish  O
outside  O
Thailand  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
take  O
back  O
my  O
words  O
after  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Phat  O
Thai  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
at  O
Sweet  O

insisted  O
that  O
I  O
must  O
try  O
their  O
it  O
.  O

Hot  O

Sour  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

The  O
Hot  O
and  O
Sour  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
came  O
with  O
big  O
fresh  O
prawns  O
,  O
straw  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
aromatics  O
.  O

We  O
like  O
the  O
spiciness  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
but  O
the  O
soup  O
could  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
sour  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O

Tofu  O
4/5  O

The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Silken  O
Tofu  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
was  O
indeed  O
smooth  O
and  O
silky  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
fresh  O
crab  O
and  O
minced  O
pork  O
filling  O
was  O
not  O
really  O
necessary  O
.  O

The  O
tofu  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
delish  O

)  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
decide  O
which  O
curry  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
because  O
they  O
were  O
all  O
as  O
good  O
with  O
their  O

3rd  O
floor  O

E.Clat  O
which  O
means  O
brilliancy  O

is  O
a  O
concept  O
by  O
a  O
groupof  O
property  O
agents  O
to  O
offer  O
fine  O
dining  O
for  O
the  O
masses  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
owner  O
also  O
mentioned  O
that  O
they  O
wanted  O
to  O
serve  O
comfort  O
and  O
fun  O
food  O
.  O

That  O
got  O
me  O
confused  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
seating  O
capacity  O
for  O
110  O
pax  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
cooking  O
studio  O

they  O
plan  O
tohold  O
cooking  O

in  O

Tomato  O
Bruschetta2/5  O

The  O
Tomato  O
Bruschetta  O
(  O
$  O
6.90  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
looked  O
rather  O
pretty  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
let  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
stale  O
home  O
made  O
foccacia  O
.  O

E.Clat  O
Cheesy  O
Onion  O
Fries  O
2.5/5  O

I  O
wastold  O
that  O
the  O
Cheesy  O
Onion  O
Fries  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
creation  O
by  O
the  O
boss  O
himself  O
.  O

The  O
cheeses  O
used  O
were  O
a  O
combination  O
of  O
mozzarella  O
and  O
cheddar  O
.  O

Iwas  O
getting  O
concerned  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
relate  O
fine  O
dining  O
,  O
comfort  O
and  O
fun  O
food  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
only  O
word  O
flashing  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
was  O
messy  O
.  O

Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
4/5  O

The  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
among  O
all  O
the  O
dishes  O
for  O
the  O
tasting  O
session  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
and  O
crisp  O
batter  O
around  O
the  O
succulent  O
and  O
fish  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
breaded  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
beer  O
battered  O
version  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
2.5/5  O

The  O
rice  O
for  O
the  O
Seafood  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
in  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
was  O
rather  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
tangy  O
tomato  O
flavour  O
was  O
not  O
distinct  O
or  O
rather  O
missing  O
from  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

It  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
if  O
the  O
kitchen  O
has  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
cheese  O
,  O
cause  O
I  O
would  O
love  O
to  O
see  O
more  O
in  O
my  O
baked  O
rice  O
.  O

Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
Pasta  O
3/5  O

The  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
Pasta  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
E.Clat  O
most  O
popular  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
well  O
marinated  O
and  O
tender  O
but  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
needs  O
more  O
kick  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Egg  O
Benedict  O
3/5  O

My  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O
yolk  O
of  O
the  O
poached  O
egg  O
oozing  O
out  O
when  O
cut  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
watered  O
down  O
and  O
I  O
disliked  O
the  O
stale  O
home  O
made  O
foccacia  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Duck  O
Pizza  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Smoked  O
Duck  O
Pizza  O
(  O
$  O
18.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crisp  O
crust  O
.  O

The  O
truffle  O
mayonnaise  O
was  O
interesting  O
butthe  O
way  O
it  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
pizza  O
,  O
I  O
had  O
trouble  O
figuring  O
how  O
best  O
to  O
consume  O
it  O
toget  O
an  O
even  O
spread  O
of  O
the  O
truffle  O
mayonnaise  O
.  O

Rum  O

Patta  O
Cotta  O
3/5  O

As  O
I  O
have  O
mentioned  O
in  O
my  O
previous  O
posts  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
Patta  O

,  O
the  O
Rum  O
and  O
Raisin  O
Patta  O
Cotta  O
(  O

not  O
memorable  O

Root  O

Float  O
(  O

the  O
Smoked  O
Salmon  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
may  O
not  O
look  O
elegant  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
used  O
of  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
onion  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
black  O
olive  O
,  O
tomato  O
and  O
bread  O
crumbs  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
,  O
a  O
healthy  O
but  O
yet  O
flavourful  O
salad  O
to  O
start  O
with  O
.  O

Tomato  O
and  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

The  O
Tomato  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
and  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
surprising  O
creamy  O
,  O
tasty  O
and  O
robust  O
.  O

Like  O
my  O
dining  O
partner  O
Melissa  O
commented  O
,  O
the  O
soups  O
were  O
much  O
better  O
than  O
a  O
popular  O
family  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
which  O
I  O
ca  O
n't  O
agreed  O
more  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Cajun  O
Fish  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Grilled  O
Cajun  O
Fish  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
salad  O
,  O
fries  O
and  O
lime  O
mayonnaise  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
fish  O
was  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
I  O
wo  O
n't  O
mind  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
gathered  O
my  O
thoughts  O
composing  O
the  O
post  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
the  O
grilled  O
fish  O
was  O
sliced  O
into  O
strips  O
.  O

Visually  O
I  O
think  O
people  O
would  O
expect  O
a  O
whole  O
piece  O
of  O
fish  O
fillet  O
so  O
they  O
do  O
n't  O
feel  O
short  O
changed  O
.  O

Baked  O
Macaroni  O
3/5  O

The  O
Baked  O
Macaroni  O
(  O
$  O
9.50  O
)  O
unfortunately  O
was  O
a  O
let  O
down  O
.  O

Though  O
the  O
macaroni  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
,  O
they  O
were  O
kind  O
of  O
bland  O
.  O

Fresh  O
Sage  O
Sausage  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Freash  O
Sausage  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
came  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
the  O
salty  O
side  O
but  O
if  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
and  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
actually  O
had  O
a  O
good  O
balanced  O
of  O
flavours  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
dish  O
at  O
Canadian  O
Pizza  O
Dine-In  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Crazy  O

The  O
Crazy  O
Canadian  O
Stacker  O
(  O

bacon  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
onion  O
rings  O
,  O

and  O

.  O

The  O
huge  O
and  O
juicy  O
burger  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
easy  O
for  O
one  O
with  O
a  O
small  O
appetite  O
.  O

Peri  O

I  O
was  O
worry  O
that  O
the  O
Peri  O
Peri  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
may  O
be  O
too  O
hot  O
for  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
quite  O
mild  O
and  O
easily  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
while  O
tender  O
inside  O

,  O
the  O
Steak  O

(  O

)  O
was  O
worth  O
the  O
penny  O
.  O

The  O
perfectly  O
grilled  O
beef  O
impressed  O
me  O
and  O
well  O
paired  O

The  O

was  O
nothing  O
to  O

for  O
but  O
decently  O
good  O
.  O

In  O
a  O

himself  O
who  O
came  O
over  O
to  O
have  O
a  O

with  O
you  O
us  O
.  O

When  O
our  O
teas  O
were  O
served  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
all  O
like  O
wondering  O
how  O
to  O
read  O
with  O
the  O
tea  O
pot  O
submerged  O
inside  O
a  O
glass  O
.  O

The  O

not  O
disappoint  O
me  O
.  O

The  O

in  O
the  O
mouth  O
lamb  O
shank  O
was  O
beautifully  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
rose  O
wine  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
herb  O
crusted  O
potatoes  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
touch  O
to  O
the  O

generous  O
with  O
the  O

from  O
Gorden  O
Ramsay  O

which  O
Maureen  O
and  O
I  O
bought  O

However  O
the  O

a  O

to  O
experience  O
Singapore  O
in  O
the  O

.  O

Every  O
Thursday  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
given  O
a  O
touch  O
of  O
nostalgia  O
.  O

Walking  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
walking  O
into  O
a  O

,  O
the  O
restaurant  O

not  O
look  O
after  O

Being  O

can  O
enjoy  O
the  O
toys  O
and  O
game  O
stations  O
at  O
the  O

they  O
know  O
of  O
the  O

If  O

when  O
I  O
attended  O
the  O
Heineken  O
Star  O

event  O
at  O
The  O
Exchange  O
,  O
the  O
organiser  O
was  O
very  O

to  O
order  O
us  O
some  O

food  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
beer  O

The  O
fried  O
white  O
bait  O
was  O
big  O
and  O
fat  O
so  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyable  O
biting  O
into  O
the  O
meaty  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
saltiness  O
of  O
the  O
white  O
bait  O
is  O
the  O
perfect  O
reason  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
wash  O
it  O
down  O
with  O
more  O
beer  O
.  O

The  O
combo  O
of  O
flavours  O
from  O
the  O
truffle  O
oil  O
and  O

simply  O
made  O
the  O

tasted  O

had  O
ordered  O

it  O
seems  O
to  O
be  O
that  O

ordered  O
the  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Lamb  O
Skewers  O
,  O
Sharing  O
Platter  O
and  O
other  O
nibbles  O
sides  O
.  O

Simply  O
loved  O
and  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
platter  O
of  O
nibbles  O
especially  O
with  O
a  O
glass  O
of  O
ice  O
cold  O

Hangar  O
Steak  O
4.5/5  O

You  O
seldom  O
get  O
to  O
see  O
restaurants  O
having  O
Hangar  O
Steak  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

Hangar  O
steak  O
is  O
a  O
cutthat  O
is  O
prized  O
for  O
its  O
flavour  O
and  O
weights  O
about  O
450g  O
to  O
675g  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
usually  O
served  O
medium  O
or  O
medium  O
rare  O
or  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
too  O
tough  O
for  O
consumption.The  O
200g  O
Hangar  O
Steak  O
(  O
$  O
40  O
)  O
I  O
had  O
was  O
very  O
bloody  O
but  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
like  O
your  O
steak  O
too  O
rare  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
not  O

Over  O
theNational  O
Day  O
long  O
weekend  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
given  O
2  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pans  O
to  O
play  O
with..oh  O
I  O
meant  O
cooked  O
with  O
.  O

Since  O
my  O
family  O
will  O
be  O
glued  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
TV  O
to  O
watch  O
the  O
National  O
Day  O
parade  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
make  O
some  O
pop  O
corns  O
for  O
the  O
family  O
to  O
snack  O
while  O
watching  O
the  O
parade  O
.  O

The  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
Saute-pan  O
is  O
perfect  O
for  O
making  O
the  O
pop  O
corns  O
.  O

With  O
its  O
transparent  O
glass  O
lid  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
easily  O
judge  O
the  O
cooking  O
temperature  O
for  O
the  O
kernel  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
helps  O
to  O
contain  O
the  O
pop  O
corns  O
inside  O
the  O
pan  O
and  O
not  O
popping  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
kitchen  O
's  O
stove  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
seeing  O
the  O
kernels  O
popping  O
and  O
dancing  O
inside  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
Saute-pan  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
now  O
make  O
pop  O
corns  O
at  O
home  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

I  O
should  O
try  O
to  O
make  O
more  O
flavours  O
of  O
pop  O
cornsnext  O
time  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
took  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
cook  O
a  O
simple  O
dinner  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
,  O
giving  O
my  O
mum  O
a  O
well  O
desired  O
break  O
.  O

The  O
Thermo-spot  O
pad  O
of  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
is  O
pretty  O
cool  O
.  O

I  O
usually  O
will  O
test  O
whether  O
the  O
pan  O
is  O
hot  O
enough  O
for  O
cooking  O
by  O
sprinkling  O
some  O
water  O
droplets  O
.  O

Now  O
with  O
the  O
Thermo-spot  O
,  O
once  O
the  O
pan  O
reached  O
the  O
optimal  O
temperature  O
of  O
180  O
Degree  O
Celsius  O
for  O
cooking  O
,  O
the  O
thermo-spot  O
will  O
become  O
solid  O
red  O
.  O

Check  O
out  O
how  O
evenly  O
and  O
beautifullythe  O
Fermented  O
Beancurd  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
turned  O
out  O
.  O

I  O
followed  O
the  O
recipes  O
from  O
WokkingMum  O
.  O

The  O
anti-warping  O
base  O
of  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
ensures  O
homogeneous  O
heat  O
diffusion  O
for  O
optimum  O
cooking  O
,  O
lowering  O
or  O
even  O
no  O
more  O
risk  O
of  O
overheating  O
and  O
burning  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
dish  O
I  O
cooked  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
was  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Omelette  O
.  O

Cooking  O
an  O
egg  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
tricky  O
.  O

If  O
the  O
pan  O
is  O
not  O
hot  O
enough  O
,  O
the  O
egg  O
will  O
stick  O
to  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

If  O
it  O
is  O
too  O
hot  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
get  O
burnt  O
easily  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
and  O
its  O
non  O
stick  O
coating  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprise  O
that  O
I  O
managed  O
to  O
fry  O
a  O
beautiful  O
vermicelli  O
omelette  O
rather  O
effortless  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
you  O
hate  O
it  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
cooking  O
you  O
still  O
need  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
washing  O
up  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
exactly  O
why  O
I  O
love  O
using  O
non  O
stick  O
pan  O
as  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
washed  O
easily  O
.  O

I  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
soak  O
it  O
with  O
warm  O
soapy  O
water  O
,  O
used  O
an  O
non  O
abrasive  O
washing  O
sponge  O
or  O
dishcloth  O
to  O
clean  O
the  O
surface  O
and  O
rinse  O
it  O
with  O
water  O
.  O

One  O
distinct  O
different  O
I  O

check  O
out  O
their  O
new  O
seafood  O
menu  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Platter  O
4/5  O

We  O
started  O
off  O
with  O
the  O
Seafood  O
Platter  O
(  O
$  O
28++  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
came  O
with  O
an  O
assortment  O
of  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
,  O
calamari  O
rings  O
,  O
battered  O
sea  O
bass  O
fillet  O
,  O
soft  O
shell  O
crab  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
french  O
fries  O
with  O
tartar  O
sauce  O
.  O

Fresh  O
fried  O
seafood  O
with  O
tartar  O
sauce  O
would  O
never  O
go  O
wrong  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
the  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
will  O
a  O
little  O
under  O
cooked  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
4/5  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
(  O
$  O
26++  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
pesto  O
sauce  O
,  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
sea  O
bass  O
was  O
beautifully  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
skin  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
pesto  O
sauce  O
pairing  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferthe  O
sauce  O
to  O
bemore  O
zesty  O
though  O
.  O

Chilli  O
Crab  O
Spaghetti  O
4/5  O

I  O
was  O
actually  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
Spaghetti  O
(  O
$  O
26++  O
)  O
.  O

Having  O
tried  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
sauce  O
at  O
Hard  O
Rock  O
Cafe  O
,  O
I  O
knew  O
it  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
fresh  O
crab  O
meats  O
and  O
the  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
coating  O
the  O
spaghetti  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
could  O
substitute  O
the  O
2  O
pieces  O
of  O
toasted  O
bread  O
for  O
a  O
crab  O
claw  O
or  O
maybe  O
some  O
fried  O
soft  O
shell  O
crabs  O
,  O
visually  O
it  O
will  O
look  O
more  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Crab  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O

Last  O
but  O
not  O
least  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Crab  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
20++  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
wok  O
fried  O
withsucculent  O
crab  O
meat  O
,  O
prawns  O
and  O
diced  O
portobello  O
mushroom  O
,  O
wrappedin  O
an  O
egg  O
omelette  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
very  O
tasty  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

Probably  O
my  O
favourite  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
4  O
new  O
seafood  O
dishes  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
taste  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

Overall  O
the  O
new  O
seafood  O
menu  O
at  O
Hard  O
Rock  O
Cafe  O
definitely  O
passed  O
the  O
mark  O
but  O

Ang  O
for  O
initiating  O
the  O
I  O
Want  O
to  O
Cook  O
For  O
My  O
Family  O
Campaign  O
giving  O
me  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
cook  O
and  O
spend  O
some  O
quality  O
time  O
with  O
my  O
family  O
.  O


If  O
you  O
have  O
been  O
following  O
my  O
blog  O
,  O
you  O
would  O
probably  O
know  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
down  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
market  O
&  O
food  O
centre  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
stalls  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
planning  O
for  O
a  O
hawker  O
trail  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
market  O
&  O
food  O
centre  O
.  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
trips  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
cafe  O
culture  O
that  O
is  O
booming  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
either  O
Forty  O
Hands  O
or  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Bakery  O
but  O
both  O
places  O
were  O
full  O
.  O

Disappointment  O
was  O
short  O
lived  O
when  O
I  O
turned  O
the  O
corner  O
onto  O
Tiong  O
Road  O
and  O
found  O
Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Blackberry  O
Almond  O
Tart  O
4/5  O

Many  O
reviews  O
have  O
mentioned  O
about  O
the  O
tarts  O
at  O
Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Since  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
and  O
Iwere  O
still  O
quite  O
full  O
from  O
lunch  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
a  O
slice  O
of  O
Blackberry  O
Almond  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
to  O
share  O
.  O

The  O
crumbly  O
pastry  O
base  O
was  O
really  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

The  O
fruity  O
topping  O
,  O
almond  O
cream  O
and  O
pastry  O
base  O
were  O
layered  O
in  O
a  O
nice  O
textural  O
balanced  O
proportion  O
.  O

What  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
is  O
the  O
seedy  O
bites  O
we  O
can  O
find  O
in  O
the  O
blackberry  O
toppings  O
.  O

Mocha  O
4/5  O

With  O
that  O
many  O
cafes  O
setting  O
up  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
area  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
name  O
``  O
Little  O
Melbourne  O
''  O
is  O
rather  O
appropriate  O
for  O
the  O
buzz  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
my  O
coffee  O
and  O
drink  O
like  O
3-4  O
cups  O
a  O
day  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
admit  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
differentiate  O
coffee  O
and  O
I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
attending  O
coffee  O
workshop  O
to  O
widen  O
by  O
knowledge  O
in  O
coffee  O
appreciation  O
.  O

Latte  O
4/5  O

Anyway  O
I  O
ordered  O
by  O
usual  O
Cafee  O
Latte  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
while  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Mocha  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
.  O

We  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
barista  O
made  O
quite  O
a  O
decent  O
cup  O
of  O
coffee  O
.  O

Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
cozy  O
place  O
to  O
laze  O
the  O
afternoon  O
sipping  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
aromatic  O
coffee  O
and  O
enjoying  O
their  O
popular  O
tarts  O
.  O

All  O
prices  O
are  O
nett  O
too  O

Jacob  O
floated  O
the  O
idea  O
with  O
Maureen  O
,  O
Shiting  O
and  O
me  O
that  O
we  O
should  O
do  O
a  O
monthly  O
dinner  O
thingy  O
todine  O
atrestaurant  O
that  O
we  O
want  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
.  O

After  O
throwing  O
a  O
few  O
suggestions  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Le  O
Bistrot  O
du  O
Sommelier  O
that  O
has  O
moved  O
from  O
its  O
previous  O
location  O
at  O
Prinsep  O
Street  O
to  O
their  O
new  O
home  O
at  O
Armenian  O
Street  O
.  O

Braised  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
4/5  O

Jacob  O
and  O
Shiting  O
both  O
had  O
the  O
Braised  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
(  O
$  O
36  O
)  O
stuffed  O
with  O
veal  O
sweetbreads  O
served  O
with  O
steamed  O
vegetables  O
and  O
mash  O
potatoes  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
and  O
presentation  O
was  O
rather  O
intimidating  O
to  O
finish  O
.  O

Not  O
to  O
forget  O
the  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O
stuffed  O
veal  O
sweetbreads  O
unless  O
you  O
have  O
an  O
enormous  O
and  O
adventurous  O
appetite  O
.  O

Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
myself  O
I  O
have  O
the  O
Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
was  O
rather  O
huge  O
again  O
consider  O
this  O
is  O
french  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
lovely  O
fork  O
tender  O
meat  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
easy  O
and  O
made  O
my  O
palate  O
sang  O
to  O
the  O
lovely  O
tunes  O
of  O
flavours  O
.  O

Braised  O
French  O
Chicken  O
Leg  O
4.2/5  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Braised  O
French  O
Chicken  O
Leg  O
(  O
$  O
28  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
interesting  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
claypot  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
leg  O
was  O
braised  O
in  O
vinegar  O
and  O
tomatoes  O
served  O
with  O
gratin  O
of  O
potatoes  O
at  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Ignoring  O
the  O
presentation  O
,  O
the  O
tangy  O
broth  O
was  O
rather  O
appertizing  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

French  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
4.2/5  O

Jacob  O
's  O
partner  O
,  O
Chloe  O
has  O
the  O
French  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
28  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
piece  O
for  O
taste  O
and  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
aromatic  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
beetroot  O
salad  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
flavour  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
balance  O
for  O
the  O
gamey  O
duck  O
.  O

day  O
,  O
Bouillabaisse  O
of  O
Red  O
Gurnard  O
(  O

)  O
.  O

Bouillabaisse  O
is  O
classic  O
French  O
fish  O
stew  O
from  O
Marseille  O
.  O

The  O
word  O
in  O
general  O
means  O
boil  O

Maureen  O
just  O
had  O
a  O

so  O
she  O
went  O
for  O

Profiteroles  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
classic  O
Profiteroles  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
simply  O
brought  O
smiles  O
to  O
our  O
faces  O
with  O
each  O
scoop  O
.  O

The  O
warm  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
and  O
sliced  O
almonds  O
toppings  O
were  O
a  O
welcome  O
boost  O
to  O
the  O
already  O
wonderful  O
dessert  O
.  O

Green  O

Sorbet  O

3/5  O

The  O
Green  O
Apple  O
Sorbet  O
with  O
Calvados  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
love  O
and  O
hate  O
affiar  O
.  O

We  O
loved  O
the  O
refreshing  O
sorbet  O
with  O
the  O
green  O
apple  O
bites  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
heavy  O
on  O
the  O
Calvados  O
,  O
a  O
type  O
of  O

As  O
it  O

After  O
hearing  O
about  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
's  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
ice  O
cream  O
from  O
Charlene  O
,  O
Jacob  O
,  O
Celes  O
and  O
me  O
made  O
our  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
parlour  O
at  O
Shaw  O
Leisure  O
Gallery  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

The  O
homemade  O
ice  O
cream  O
parlour  O
has  O
been  O
scooping  O
ice  O
cream  O
since  O
September  O
2005  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
quite  O
surprise  O
that  O
they  O
were  O
around  O
even  O
before  O
popular  O
ice  O
cream  O
parlour  O
such  O
as  O
Udders  O
,  O
Ice  O

,  O

.  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Chocolate  O
4/5  O

Celes  O
had  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
medium  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
ice  O
cream  O
definitely  O
did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
tasteand  O
grainy  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
resembles  O
those  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
one  O
can  O
find  O
in  O
mooncakes  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
noticed  O
that  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
melted  O
very  O
quickly  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
up  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
's  O
website  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
they  O
do  O
not  O
add  O
stabilisers  O
in  O
their  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
as  O
natural  O
as  O
it  O
can  O
get  O
for  O
their  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

Although  O
stabilisers  O
are  O
extracted  O
from  O
natural  O
sources  O
such  O
as  O
seaweed  O
and  O
algae  O
and  O
added  O
to  O
ice  O
cream  O
to  O
slow  O
down  O
the  O
melting  O
process  O
,  O
the  O
source  O
is  O
natural  O
but  O
the  O
extraction  O
method  O
is  O
man  O
made  O
.  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
and  O
Quattro  O
4/5  O

For  O
me  O
,  O
I  O
tired  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Quattro  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
medium  O
)  O
.  O

Quattro  O
was  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
July  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
made  O
with  O
sangria  O
,  O
pineapple  O
,  O
raisin  O
and  O
orange  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
very  O
interesting  O
taste  O
for  O
ice  O
cream  O
and  O
the  O
closest  O
similarity  O
will  O
be  O
Japanese  O
sake  O
,  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O

Classic  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Classic  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
16.50  O
)  O
was  O
made  O
using  O
chicken  O
and  O
veal  O
broth  O
with  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
accompanied  O
by  O
cheese  O
toasts  O
made  O
from  O
Antoinette  O
's  O
signature  O
24-hour  O
baguette  O
.  O

Traditionally  O
the  O
soup  O
is  O
covered  O
with  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
cheese  O
and  O
broiled  O
to  O
brown  O
before  O
serving  O
.  O

At  O
Antoinette  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
substituted  O
with  O
a  O
cheese  O
crust  O
cover  O
made  O
from  O
combo  O
of  O
parmesan  O
and  O
gruyere  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
richness  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
had  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
tangy  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyablethat  O
paired  O
wellwith  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
.  O

Tartine  O
de  O
Nicoise  O
4/5  O

The  O
Tartine  O
de  O
Nicoise  O
(  O
$  O
26.00  O
)  O
was  O
crowned  O
by  O
a  O
bed  O
ofbutter  O
lettuce  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
,  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
olives  O
,  O
a  O
three-minute  O
egg  O
,  O
anchovy  O
and  O
seared  O
tuna  O
on  O
topan  O

face  O
levain  O
sandwich.The  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
levain  O
bread  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
proprietary  O
yeast  O
starter  O
and  O
takes  O
18  O
days  O
to  O
make  O
.  O

The  O
bread  O
was  O
soft  O
and  O
fluffy  O
with  O
a  O
tangy  O
flavour  O
amid  O
a  O
hard  O
crispy  O
crust  O
.  O

Confit  O

The  O
Confit  O
de  O
Poitrine  O
de  O
Porc  O
(  O
$  O
36  O
)  O
or  O
simply  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Confit  O
was  O
cured  O
in  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
sea  O
salt  O
,  O
brown  O
sugar  O
and  O
aromatics  O
,  O
and  O
then  O
cooked  O
,  O
covered  O
in  O
duck  O
fat  O
for  O
90  O
degrees  O
Celsius  O
over  O
12  O
hours  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
thecrackling  O
skin  O
was  O
abit  O
darker  O
in  O
colour  O
which  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
if  O
it  O
was  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
brown  O
sugar  O
during  O
the  O
curing  O
process.The  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
garlic  O
mash  O
,  O
seasonal  O
vegetables  O
,  O
and  O
mustard  O
sauce  O
.  O

Bouchees  O
aux  O
fruits  O
de  O
mer  O
3.5/5  O

My  O
first  O
impression  O
of  O
theBouchees  O
aux  O
fruits  O
de  O
mer  O
(  O
$  O
30  O
)  O
resembles  O
the  O
chinese  O
yam  O
basket  O
.  O

The  O
puff  O
pastry  O
case  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
luxurious  O
seafood  O
medley  O
of  O
scallops  O
,  O
prawns  O
,  O
squid  O
and  O
mussels  O
sauteed  O
with  O
white  O
wine  O
and  O
cream  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
quite  O
impressed  O
that  O
the  O
pastry  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
considering  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
layers  O
involved  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
ingredients  O
did  O
n't  O
come  O
together  O
as  O
one  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
complex  O
or  O
difficult  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
seafood  O
and  O
pastry  O
as  O
a  O
whole  O
.  O

I  O
wouldgladly  O
havethe  O
seafood  O
and  O
pastry  O
separately  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Crumble  O
Pasta  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Crumble  O
Pasta  O
(  O
$  O
26  O
)  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

First  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
parsley  O
pesto  O
to  O
the  O
more  O
common  O
basil  O
pesto  O
.  O

Next  O
was  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
homemade  O
anchovy  O
crumble  O
that  O
was  O
sprinkled  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
pasta  O
.  O

Iwas  O
quite  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
pasta  O
that  O
had  O
both  O
textures  O
and  O
flavours  O
working  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

Besides  O
a  O
wide  O
repertoireof  O
savoury  O
items  O
,  O
Le  O
Jardin  O

also  O
has  O
a  O
exquisite  O
selection  O
of  O
desserts  O
that  O
Antoinette  O
is  O
well  O
known  O
for  O
amid  O
its  O
luxuriant  O
setting  O
.  O

After  O
a  O
hearty  O
meal  O
,  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
4  O
of  O
Chef  O
Pang  O

new  O
2012  O
collection  O
of  O

,  O

,  O

,  O

I  O
do  O
not  O
really  O
have  O
a  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
and  O
the  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Chloe  O

Chloe  O
(  O

)  O
is  O
a  O
white  O

and  O
almond  O

combined  O
with  O
refreshing  O
and  O
fragrant  O

Best  O
to  O
enjoy  O
with  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
tea  O
to  O
wash  O
down  O
the  O
sweetness  O
.  O

Tarte  O
Exotique  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Tarte  O
Exotique  O
(  O
$  O
8.50  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
desserts  O
among  O
thefour  O
we  O
tried  O
.  O

A  O
luscious  O
gula  O
melaka  O
cremeux  O
,  O
finger  O
sponge  O
and  O
a  O
light  O
coconut  O

delicate  O
mango  O
and  O
passion  O
fruit  O
coulis  O
sphere  O
sitting  O
on  O
an  O
almond  O
base  O
.  O

The  O
technique  O
and  O
used  O
of  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
in  O
the  O
subtle  O
dessert  O
just  O
demonstrate  O
the  O
chef  O
's  O
talent  O
and  O
prowess  O
in  O
his  O
forte  O
.  O

The  O
layers  O
of  O

was  O
rather  O
new  O
to  O

a  O

Roast  O
Tomahawk  O
Veal  O

The  O
huge  O
Roast  O
Tomahawk  O
Veal  O
was  O
the  O
most  O
eyes  O
catching  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
and  O
I  O
simply  O
could  O
n't  O
resist  O
having  O
a  O
slice  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Look  O

the  O

My  O
personal  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
sausages  O
,  O
beef  O
tenderloin  O
and  O
duck  O
confit  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
knucles  O
and  O
lamb  O
were  O
good  O
too  O
...  O
oh  O
my  O
god  O
,  O
I  O
just  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
stomach  O
to  O
eat  O
them  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
buffet  O

.  O

The  O
laksa  O
is  O
a  O
MUST  O
TRY  O
here  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
broth  O
was  O
robust  O
with  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavour  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
,  O
a  O
decent  O
selection  O
of  O
desserts  O
are  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
buffet  O

a  O

A  O

Underground  O
oven  O
known  O
as  O

For  O
the  O
imu  O
style  O
barbeque  O
,  O
the  O
team  O
is  O
using  O
a  O
combination  O
of  O
Pepes  O
(  O
Indonesian  O
cooking  O
method  O
using  O
banana  O
leaf  O
as  O

of  O

(  O

)  O
,  O
the  O

Assorted  O
Seafood  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Assorted  O
Seafood  O
in  O
imu  O
style  O
barbeque  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
spicy  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
garlic  O
and  O
sambal  O
.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
robust  O
seafood  O
flavours  O
.  O

Vertical  O
Grill  O

The  O
Vertical  O
Grill  O
is  O
an  O
barbeque  O
technique  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
.  O

The  O
seafood  O
were  O
cooked  O
by  O
the  O
heat  O
radiated  O
from  O
the  O
fire  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
of  O
the  O
pit  O
.  O

BBQ  O
Prawn  O

BBQ  O
Squid  O

Normally  O
barbeque  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
hard  O
to  O
control  O
the  O
fire  O
and  O
usually  O
you  O
will  O
end  O
up  O
with  O
charred  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
used  O
of  O
heat  O
from  O
the  O
vertical  O
grill  O
ensured  O
that  O
the  O
Prawns  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
and  O
Squid  O
(  O
$  O
5  O

overcooked  O
with  O
better  O
control  O
of  O
the  O

Beer  O
Pork  O
Sausages  O
(  O
$  O

The  O
smoky  O
flavour  O
was  O
more  O
distinct  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
beer  O
flavour.The  O
beer  O
flavour  O
was  O
more  O
intense  O
in  O
the  O
sauce  O
instead  O
.  O

The  O
Lemon  O
Sole  O
(  O
a  O
type  O

did  O
not  O
look  O
appealing  O

the  O

were  O
there  O
,  O
the  O
preparation  O
of  O
the  O
squid  O
ink  O
pasta  O
was  O
a  O
disappointment  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O

was  O
coated  O
instead  O
of  O
infusing  O

were  O
here  O
for  O
the  O

with  O
the  O
cosy  O

warm  O
and  O
relax  O
ambient  O
of  O

(  O

were  O
served  O

Half  O
of  O
This  O
and  O
Half  O
of  O
That  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
find  O
it  O
very  O
thoughtful  O
for  O
Cafe  O
Epicurious  O
to  O
offer  O
the  O
Half  O
of  O
This  O
&  O
Half  O
of  O
That  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
on  O
its  O
menu  O
for  O
those  O
that  O
is  O
indecisive  O
.  O

We  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Green  O
Egg  O
&  O
Ham  O
and  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
combination  O
.  O

The  O
green  O
egg  O
is  O
exactlybasil  O

scrambled  O
egg  O
.  O

It  O
camewith  O
prosciutto  O
and  O
topped  O
with  O
parmigiano  O
reggiano  O
.  O

The  O
basil  O
pesto  O
and  O
pramigiano  O
reggiano  O
lifted  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
moist  O
and  O
creamy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
.  O

The  O
poached  O
egg  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
with  O
the  O
egg  O
yolk  O
oozing  O
out  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
others  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
sour  O
,  O
I  O
actually  O
liked  O
that  O
mild  O
tang  O
taste  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
the  O
sauce  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
rich  O
and  O
buttery  O
.  O

Baked  O

The  O

the  O
Baked  O

(  O

.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
this  O
way  O
of  O
enjoying  O
egg  O
,  O
dipping  O
the  O
toast  O
into  O
the  O
creamy  O
and  O
cheesy  O
baked  O
egg  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
to  O
associate  O
it  O
with  O
our  O
local  O
half  O
boiled  O
egg  O
.  O

Do  O
I  O
prefer  O
the  O
East  O
or  O
West  O
way  O
?  O

I  O
would  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
prefer  O
my  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
pepper  O
over  O
cream  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
baked  O
eggs  O
was  O
good  O
and  O
I  O
only  O
blamed  O
it  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
born  O
with  O
an  O
Asian  O
palate  O
.  O

French  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
yam  O
coated  O
with  O
rich  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
was  O
so  O
addictive  O
.  O

The  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yam  O
Chips  O
(  O
$  O
9.80  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
firmer  O
texture  O
compared  O
to  O
using  O
potato  O
.  O

It  O
gave  O
that  O
shiok  O
crackling  O
crisp  O
sound  O
with  O
each  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

Balachan  O
Crab  O
3.8/5  O

I  O
asked  O
for  O
the  O
Balachan  O
Crab  O
(  O
$  O
19.90  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
29.90  O

)  O
as  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seenthis  O
cooking  O
style  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
before  O
.  O

The  O
dried  O
style  O
balachan  O
crab  O
came  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
fried  O
shallots  O
and  O
some  O
curry  O
leaves  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
an  O
unique  O
spicy  O
and  O
salty  O
combination  O
which  O
was  O
good  O
but  O
not  O
fantastic  O
.  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Crab  O
4.5/5  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
try  O
,  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Crab  O
(  O

23.90  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
33.90  O

.  O

This  O
is  O
Irvin  O
's  O
specialty  O
with  O
Chef  O
Yap  O
's  O
special  O
recipe  O
.  O

I  O
liked  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
curry  O
leaves  O
are  O
added  O
to  O
give  O
the  O
sauce  O
the  O
extra  O
kick  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
crab  O
was  O
basically  O
swimming  O
in  O
the  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
is  O
so  O
well  O
received  O
by  O
the  O
customers  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
selling  O
it  O
at  O
$  O
12  O
per  O
box  O
,  O
freshly  O
made  O
upon  O
order  O
.  O

Maybe  O
I  O
should  O
get  O
a  O
box  O
for  O
my  O
nacho  O
.  O

The  O

coated  O
with  O
the  O
savoury  O

.  O

Again  O

Red  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
Red  O
Tilapia  O
with  O
Special  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
32  O
)  O
is  O
not  O
listed  O

,  O
you  O
have  O
to  O
ask  O
the  O
waiter/waitress  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
red  O

was  O

Claypot  O
Pumpkin  O
Prawns  O
4/5  O

Our  O
palates  O
were  O
kind  O
of  O
tired  O
and  O
confused  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
and  O
butter  O
sauce  O
dishes  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Claypot  O
Pumpkin  O
Prawns  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
22.80  O
large  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
reconfirm  O
with  O
the  O
kitchen  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
not  O
used  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
instead  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
except  O
that  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
smoother  O
.  O

Same  O
technique  O
of  O
using  O
chilli  O
padi  O
and  O
curry  O
leaves  O
to  O
lift  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
colour  O
looked  O
exactly  O
the  O
same  O
.  O

The  O
pumpkin  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
but  O
I  O
really  O
could  O
not  O
taste  O
the  O
distinct  O
pumpkin  O
flavour  O
.  O

Salted  O
French  O
Beans  O
4/5  O

Finally  O
some  O
greens  O
after  O
all  O
therich  O
and  O
creamy  O
dishes  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
Salted  O
French  O
Beans  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
15.80  O
large  O
)  O
still  O
had  O
the  O
crunchiness  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
chilli  O
padi  O
,  O
dried  O
shrimps  O
and  O
fried  O
shallots  O
completed  O
the  O
flavours  O
making  O
it  O
a  O
light  O
and  O
delectable  O
dish  O
.  O

reminded  O
me  O
of  O

The  O

these  O
gigantic  O
food  O
items  O
whichwe  O

Oysters  O
4.5/5  O

Usually  O
when  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
buffet  O
,  O
I  O
will  O
start  O
with  O
the  O
cold  O
section  O
and  O
I  O
definitely  O
will  O
have  O
the  O
oysters  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
will  O
not  O
have  O
more  O
than  O
3  O
so  O
that  O
I  O
leave  O
space  O
for  O
the  O
other  O
buffet  O
spread  O
down  O
the  O
line  O
.  O

I  O
broke  O
the  O
rule  O
at  O
The  O
Square  O
and  O
went  O
back  O
for  O
another  O
4-5  O
serving  O
of  O
their  O
oysters  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
cold  O
section  O
is  O
not  O
big  O
but  O
their  O
oysters  O
were  O
very  O
fresh  O
,  O
big  O
and  O
full  O
.  O

Cooked  O
Salmon  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
lovely  O
cooked  O
Salmon  O
was  O
huge  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
,  O
moist  O
and  O
creamy  O
.  O

A  O
wide  O
variety  O
of  O
cooked  O
food  O
indulging  O
you  O
to  O
various  O
international  O
flavours  O
and  O
cuisines  O
are  O
available  O
at  O
the  O

.  O

Cheese  O
Risotto  O
4.5/5  O

I  O
felt  O
very  O
privileged  O
to  O
have  O
Chef  O
Jean-Philippe  O
cooking  O
personally  O
for  O
us  O
the  O
risotto  O
and  O
poached  O
cod  O
fish  O
.  O

The  O
risottowas  O
first  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
pan  O
,  O
transferred  O
andtossed  O
in  O
the  O
huge  O
parmasen  O
cheese  O
wheel  O
to  O
have  O
an  O
even  O
coating  O
of  O
cheese  O
on  O
each  O
grain  O
.  O

Simply  O
love  O
the  O
intense  O
and  O
rich  O
cheesy  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
Cheese  O
Risotto  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
was  O
not  O
mushy  O
or  O
under  O
cooked  O
,  O
still  O
having  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Laksa  O
Risotto  O
4/5  O

Chef  O
Jean  O
Philippe  O
cooked  O
us  O
2  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Laksa  O
Risotto  O
.  O

One  O
with  O
cheese  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
without  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
mixed  O
preference  O
and  O
I  O
preferred  O
the  O
one  O
without  O
cheese  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
the  O
cheese  O
confused  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
laksa  O
which  O
was  O
the  O
core  O
and  O
uniqueness  O
of  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Poached  O
Cod  O
Fillet  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Poached  O
Cod  O
Fillet  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
is  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
cod  O
fillet  O
was  O
poached  O
in  O
spicy  O
coconut  O
and  O
prawn  O
broth  O
,  O
served  O
with  O
sauteed  O
vegetables  O
and  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
liked  O
the  O
thick  O
and  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
which  O
had  O
a  O
nce  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
,  O
making  O
it  O
very  O
addictive  O
.  O

Laksa  O
3.8/5  O

Like  O
all  O
hotel  O
buffet  O
line  O
,  O
thereare  O
also  O
live  O
stations  O
and  O
local  O
fares  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
laksa  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
made  O
a  O
point  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Laksa  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
missed  O
its  O
mark  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
lacked  O
both  O
the  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavours  O
and  O
rich  O
coconut  O
cream  O
.  O

Most  O
people  O
would  O
leave  O
the  O
dessert  O
to  O
the  O
last  O
so  O
as  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
meal  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
the  O
same  O
for  O
me  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
Sqaure  O
does  O
offer  O
a  O
good  O
spread  O
of  O
delectable  O
desserts  O
.  O

Do  O
try  O
the  O
Durian  O
Pengat  O
and  O
Lemon  O
custard  O
in  O
chocolate  O
cup  O
tart  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
my  O
favourite  O
among  O
all  O
the  O
desserts  O
.  O

The  O
last  O
time  O
I  O
visit  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Market  O
&  O
Food  O
Centre  O
was  O
probably  O
more  O
than  O
5  O
years  O
ago  O
.  O

My  O
memory  O
of  O
Tiong  O
BahruFood  O
Centre  O
was  O
bad  O
air  O
circulation  O
,  O
small  O
and  O
crowded  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
has  O
since  O
undergone  O
renovationand  O
now  O
it  O
is  O
more  O
spacious  O
with  O
good  O
air  O
circulation  O
.  O

There  O
were  O
many  O
reviews  O
on  O
Lor  O

Since  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
the  O
stall  O
's  O
lor  O
mee  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
to  O
find  O
out  O
why  O
so  O
many  O
people  O
queued  O
up  O
for  O
their  O

Thewinner  O
for  O
the  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
shark  O
nuggets  O
.  O

The  O
shark  O
meat  O
was  O
surprisely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
the  O
crispy  O
fritter  O
.  O

Different  O
from  O
other  O
stalls  O
,  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
lor  O

did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O

.  O

I  O
also  O
found  O
the  O

My  O
mother  O
reads  O
the  O
Wanbao  O

newspaper  O
and  O
I  O
like  O
to  O
browse  O
through  O
the  O
paper  O
's  O
food  O
column  O
.  O

It  O
always  O
introduced  O
local  O
fare  O
and  O
I  O
will  O
make  O
a  O
note  O
to  O
visit  O
them  O
if  O
I  O
came  O
across  O
an  O
interesting  O
stall  O
.  O

Recently  O
Anchor  O
Beer  O
has  O
a  O
contest  O
in  O
Wanbao  O
(  O
)  O
newspaper  O
nominated  O
by  O
their  O
readers  O
for  O
the  O
top  O
5  O
favourite  O
braised  O
duck  O
.  O

Seng  O
Kee  O
's  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
5  O
finalist  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
address  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
passing  O
by  O
this  O
stall  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
8  O
years  O
in  O
my  O
journey  O
home  O
from  O
work  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
there  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
belongs  O
Shiting  O
's  O
uncle  O
,  O
a  O
foodie  O
friend  O
of  O
mine.After  O
firing  O
a  O
few  O

,  O
we  O
met  O
up  O
for  O
a  O

with  O

Shiting  O

Braised  O
Duck  O
4.2/5  O

Since  O
Seng  O
Kee  O
was  O
the  O
top  O
5  O
finalist  O
for  O
their  O
braised  O
duck  O
,  O
definitely  O
we  O
must  O
taste  O
it  O
to  O
know  O
why  O
.  O

With  O
over  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
braising  O
experience  O
,  O
no  O
wonder  O
the  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
tradition  O
,  O
similar  O
to  O
how  O
my  O
grandma  O
would  O
have  O
done  O
it  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
around  O

Not  O
overly  O
intense  O
in  O
flavours  O
,  O
just  O
simple  O
and  O
light  O
but  O
tasty  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
duck  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
fat  O
with  O
just  O
a  O
slight  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
underneath  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
there  O
for  O
just  O
a  O
simple  O
lunch  O
,  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O

cost  O

the  O

many  O
nice  O
places  O
to  O
eat  O
in  O
JB  O

it  O

Ive  O
decided  O
to  O
introduce  O

just  O
5  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
JB  O
food  O
places  O
that  O
are  O
all  O
within  O
10  O
minutes  O
of  O
leisurely  O
walk  O
after  O
clearing  O
Malaysian  O
immigration  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
good  O
eating  O
places  O
within  O
10  O
minutes  O
walk  O
in  O
JBs  O
old  O
downtown  O
area  O
.  O

Here  O
is  O
the  O
sketch  O
map  O
of  O
where  O
my  O
5  O
favourite  O
places  O
are  O
located  O
.  O

After  O
clearing  O
immigration  O
,  O
walk  O
out  O
of  O
City  O
Square  O
shopping  O
centre  O
and  O
go  O
onto  O
the  O
main  O
street  O
,  O
Jalan  O
Wong  O
Ah  O
Fook  O
.  O

.  O

Walk  O
along  O
Jalan  O
Wong  O
Ah  O
Fook  O
and  O
head  O
towards  O
the  O
direction  O
of  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Look  O
out  O
for  O
this  O
Hindu  O
temple  O
along  O
Jalan  O
Ungku  O
Puan  O
,  O
which  O
you  O
can  O
use  O
as  O
a  O
reference  O
point  O
.  O

Then  O
follow  O
the  O
directions  O
on  O
the  O
sketch  O
map  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
there  O
early  O
and  O
need  O
a  O
morning  O
coffee  O
,  O
I  O
suggest  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
coffee  O
and  O
half  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
at  O
Kin  O
Wah  O
coffee  O
shop  O
.  O

The  O
traditional  O
office  O
here  O
is  O
full  O
bodied  O
and  O
robustly  O
flavoured  O
.  O

The  O
perfectly  O
done  O
half  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
here  O
are  O
made  O
from  O
kampung  O
chicken  O
eggs  O
.  O

The  O
eggs  O
have  O
a  O
heavier  O
texture  O
and  O
more  O
distinct  O
aroma  O
of  O
fresh  O
eggs  O
.  O

This  O
Hainanese  O
kopitiam  O
is  O
packed  O
the  O
whole  O
day  O
with  O
customers  O
of  O
all  O
races  O
and  O
from  O
all  O
walks  O
of  O
life  O
.  O

I  O
havent  O
tried  O
their  O
toast  O
buns  O
and  O
breads  O
myself  O
but  O
I  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
very  O
popular  O
.  O

Many  O
people  O
also  O
order  O
their  O
mee  O
siam  O
here  O
.  O

Business  O
can  O
get  O
very  O
hectic  O
here  O
and  O
the  O
harried  O
staff  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
edge  O
.  O

A  O
short  O
walk  O
away  O
is  O
Ah  O
Hua  O
kway  O
teow  O
soup  O
.  O

This  O
old  O
shop  O
has  O
been  O
here  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
and  O
is  O
today  O
run  O
by  O
the  O
third  O
generation  O
.  O

They  O
still  O
use  O
charcoal  O
to  O
boil  O
the  O
soup  O
stock  O
something  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
anywhere  O
else  O
.  O

RM16  O
gets  O
you  O
the  O
Kings  O
version  O
loaded  O
with  O
abalone  O
,  O
fresh  O
oysters  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
extra  O
luxuries  O
.  O

Personally  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
perfectly  O
happy  O
with  O
the  O
basic  O
RM5  O
version  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
old  O
traditional  O
flavours  O
of  O
Teochew  O
kway  O
teow  O
soup  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
like  O
Western  O
,  O
I  O
suggest  O
you  O
try  O
IT  O
Roo  O
cafe  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
another  O
very  O
old  O
Hainanese  O
caf  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
famed  O
for  O
their  O
chicken  O
chops  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
chop  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O
big  O
slab  O
of  O
thigh  O
,  O
crispy  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
and  O
juicy  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
chop  O
comes  O
with  O
their  O
addictive  O
fresh  O
mushroom  O
sauce  O
.  O

Be  O
early  O
as  O
IT  O
Roo  O
is  O
always  O
packed  O
during  O
lunch  O
and  O
you  O
may  O
have  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
your  O
seat  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
same  O
area  O
is  O
Hiap  O
Joo  O
bakery  O
.  O

This  O
traditional  O
bakery  O
still  O
uses  O
their  O
old  O
wood  O
fired  O
oven  O
to  O
bake  O
their  O
cakes  O
and  O
pastries  O
.  O

Hiap  O
Joos  O
banana  O
cake  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
.  O

Go  O
inside  O
the  O
shop  O
and  O
you  O
will  O
see  O
the  O
huge  O
charcoal  O
oven  O
,  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
like  O
combs  O
of  O
bananas  O
used  O
to  O
make  O
the  O
cakes  O
.  O

No  O
artificial  O
flavouring  O
is  O
used  O
here  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
difference  O
,  O
instantly  O
.  O

I  O
always  O
bring  O
home  O
something  O
from  O
Hiap  O
Joo  O
whenever  O
I  O
pass  O
by  O
this  O
shop  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
stay  O
beyond  O
5:00pm  O
,  O
try  O
this  O
BBQ  O
chicken  O
stall  O
in  O
Meldrum  O
Walk  O
.  O

Medrum  O
Walk  O
is  O
a  O
back  O
lane  O
food  O
paradise  O
something  O
we  O
can  O
not  O
find  O
anywhere  O
in  O
Singapore  O
anymore  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
many  O
good  O
food  O
stalls  O
here  O
and  O
my  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
BBQ  O
chicken  O
stall  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
charcoal  O
roasted  O
chicken  O
literally  O
drips  O
with  O
sweet  O
natural  O
juices  O
.  O

The  O
juice  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
,  O
I  O
actually  O
felt  O
bad  O
that  O
some  O
of  O
it  O
inevitably  O
dripped  O
onto  O
the  O
plate  O
when  O
I  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
such  O
a  O
waste  O
J  O
There  O
are  O
many  O
other  O
good  O
food  O
stalls  O
and  O
shops  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
when  O
you  O
are  O
in  O
JB  O
.  O

JB  O
is  O
generally  O
safe  O
but  O
please  O
do  O
be  O
alert  O
and  O
take  O
the  O
usual  O
precautions  O
e.g  O
.  O

move  O
away  O
when  O
approached  O
by  O
Scratch  O
and  O
Win  O
scammers  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
easy  O
to  O
enjoy  O
JB  O
food  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
knowledge  O
of  O
where  O
the  O
good  O
eating  O
places  O
are  O
J  O
.  O

Wish  O
you  O
happy  O
eating  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
myVillage  O
mall  O
dining  O
voucher  O
to  O
spend  O
before  O
it  O
expired.After  O
looking  O
through  O
the  O
list  O
of  O
restaurants  O
in  O
the  O
mall  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Relish  O
with  O
my  O
partner  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
afternoon  O
.  O

Relish  O
is  O
a  O
restaurant  O
under  O
the  O
Wild  O
Rocket  O
Group  O
andowned  O
by  O
Chef  O
Willin  O
known  O
for  O
his  O
Asian-western  O
fusion  O
creation  O
.  O

Mocha  O
and  O
Coconut  O
&  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
Milkshake  O
4.2/5  O

We  O
started  O
with  O
drinks  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Coconut  O
&  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
Milkshake  O
(  O
$  O
8.00  O
)  O
as  O
I  O
never  O
had  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

The  O
name  O
itself  O
also  O
aroused  O
my  O
interest  O
.  O

The  O
interesting  O
combination  O
of  O
flavours  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
which  O
I  O
can  O
distinctly  O
identified  O
the  O
individual  O
core  O
flavours  O
.  O

Sarawak  O
Shepherds  O
Pie  O
4.2/5  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Sarawak  O
Shepherds  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
16.80  O
)  O
that  O
has  O
curry  O
chicken  O
inside  O
the  O
bed  O
of  O
mashed  O
potato  O
.  O

We  O
all  O
know  O
and  O
loveourAsian  O
curry  O
and  O
potato  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
the  O
chef  O
has  O
infusedthem  O
into  O
a  O
western  O
dish  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
harmony  O
with  O
the  O
ingredients  O
and  O
flavours  O
,  O
not  O
stealling  O
the  O
show  O
from  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

We  O
really  O
applauded  O
the  O
creation  O
and  O
we  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
love  O
to  O
have  O
it  O
again  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

Wild  O
Rocket  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
110g  O
4/5  O

Relish  O
is  O
known  O
for  O
its  O
burgers  O
before  O
it  O
introduced  O
other  O
hearty  O
mains  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Going  O
back  O
to  O
what  O
they  O
are  O
popular  O
for  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
Wild  O
Rocket  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
110g  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
burger  O
came  O
with  O
sun-dried  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
rockets  O
and  O
Sarawak  O
pepper  O
cream  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
just  O
the  O
right  O
size  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
handled  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
patty  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
looked  O
overcooked  O
and  O
dry  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
wronged  O
.  O

Biting  O
it  O
into  O
,  O
the  O
juiciness  O
started  O
oozing  O
out  O
from  O
the  O
patty  O
and  O
dripping  O
onto  O
my  O
hand  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
way  O
the  O
restaruant  O
charges  O
for  O
any  O
add  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
burger  O
.  O

The  O
sunny  O
side  O
up  O
cost  O
me  O
an  O
additioal  O
$  O
1.80  O
which  O
I  O
probably  O
can  O
buya  O
dozen  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

numerous  O
time  O

I  O
always  O
spotted  O
a  O

at  O
the  O

I  O
was  O
feeling  O
a  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
You  O
Tiao  O
which  O
is  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
chinese  O
crullers  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O

tender  O
inside  O

The  O
fried  O

it  O

Rock  O

not  O

were  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
catch  O
my  O
attention  O
.  O

The  O
chunky  O
fresh  O
fruits  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
sponge  O
and  O
the  O
light  O
fresh  O
cream  O
were  O
like  O
a  O
beautiful  O
art  O
piece  O
thatwas  O
pure  O
visual  O
enjoyment.The  O
cakes  O
were  O
not  O
overly  O
sweet  O
and  O
the  O
lightness  O
in  O
both  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
were  O
very  O
delectable  O
.  O

I  O
am  O

a  O

because  O
I  O
always  O
find  O
them  O
too  O
sweet  O
,  O

and  O

.  O

I  O
think  O
Naomi  O

has  O
changed  O

at  O
Naomi  O

brought  O
thetraditional  O

to  O
a  O
new  O
level  O
.  O

Before  O
my  O
visit  O
to  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
I  O
only  O
know  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
Swiss  O
Roll  O
and  O
Sugar  O
Roll  O
from  O
Polar  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Now  O
the  O
conventional  O
rolls  O
have  O
been  O
injected  O
with  O
more  O
flavours  O
and  O
creativity  O
.  O

Thecottony  O
softsponge  O
rolled  O
up  O
with  O
fresh  O
cream  O
and  O
chunk  O
of  O
fruits  O
or  O
nuts  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
were  O
distinctly  O
flavourful  O
and  O
not  O
overly  O
sweet  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
looking  O
for  O
something  O
unique  O
,  O
try  O
the  O
Strawberry  O
Mango  O
Pudding  O
Fruit  O
Roll  O
.  O

Who  O
would  O
have  O
imagine  O
you  O
can  O
have  O
both  O
fruit  O
and  O
pudding  O
inside  O
a  O
sponge  O
roll  O
.  O

Grape  O
Cheese  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Grape  O
Cheese  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
2.20  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
sponge  O
base  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
jellyand  O
grapes  O
.  O

The  O
cheese  O
cake  O
was  O
rather  O
different  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
taste  O
very  O
cheesy  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
different.It  O
was  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
mousse  O
cake  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
4/5  O

If  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
your  O
Tiramisu  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
strong  O
on  O
the  O
liquor  O
or  O
too  O
heavy  O
on  O
the  O
coffee  O
flavour  O
,  O
you  O
will  O
probably  O
like  O
the  O
Tiramisu  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
at  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
intense  O
flavours  O
which  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
easy  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Sheperd  O
Pie  O

,  O

and  O
onions  O
topped  O
with  O
creamy  O

and  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
one  O
I  O
had  O
is  O
the  O
regular  O
size  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
in  O

I  O

Anyway  O
,  O
cut  O
the  O
story  O
short  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Hougang  O
Mall  O
looking  O
for  O
lunch  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
dine  O
at  O
the  O

The  O

of  O
the  O

a  O
very  O
chinese  O
theme  O

The  O

impressed  O
me  O
most  O
.  O

The  O
headache  O
about  O
eating  O
at  O
food  O
court  O
is  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
so  O
many  O
choices  O
.  O

After  O
I  O
have  O
recce  O
the  O

to  O

I  O
find  O

I  O
like  O
to  O
add  O
a  O

of  O

to  O
give  O
the  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
invited  O
by  O
Fan  O
Play  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
their  O
Chee  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
asking  O
myself  O
will  O
I  O
be  O
full  O
?  O

What  O
is  O
so  O
special  O
about  O
it  O
?  O

Is  O
there  O
a  O
post  O
angle  O
for  O
my  O
readers  O
?  O

I  O
guess  O
you  O
probably  O
have  O
the  O
same  O
questions  O
in  O
your  O
head  O
now  O
.  O

Well  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
was  O
totally  O
wrong  O
about  O
it.Glad  O
thatI  O
went  O
down  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
proudly  O
share  O
this  O
post  O
with  O
you  O
.  O

Fan  O
Play  O
is  O
actually  O
located  O
inside  O
Carrefour  O
at  O
the  O

Patrons  O
can  O
actually  O
take  O

or  O

Beer  O
Battered  O
Dory  O
with  O
Brown  O
Sauce  O
4.5/5  O

Robert  O
the  O
owner  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
the  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
is  O
specially  O
imported  O
from  O
Ipoh  O
twice  O
weekly  O
which  O
the  O
historic  O
town  O
is  O
famous  O
for  O
.  O

He  O
tried  O
manufacturing  O
it  O
in  O
Singapore  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
.  O

He  O
said  O
the  O
water  O
used  O
in  O
Ipoh  O
is  O
different  O
and  O
hence  O
the  O
difference  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
authentic  O
Ipoh  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
,  O
Fan  O
Play  O
also  O
introduces  O
savory  O
gravies  O
atop  O
thesilky  O
smooth  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Dory  O
with  O
Brown  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
my  O
first  O
thoughtwas  O
this  O
is  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
not  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
.  O

Robert  O
explained  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
indeed  O
authentic  O
Ipoh  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
rice  O
flour  O
and  O
water  O
only  O
.  O

I  O
mentioned  O
earlier  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
sceptical  O
whether  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
full  O
since  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
is  O
usually  O
eaten  O
as  O
a  O
snack  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
serving  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
a  O
full  O
meal  O
!  O
.  O

The  O
beer  O
battered  O
dory  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
in  O
the  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
special  O
brown  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
was  O
lightfor  O
the  O
palatethat  O
just  O
married  O
the  O
cheong  O
fan  O
perfectly  O
.  O

You  O
may  O
think  O
this  O
is  O
crazy  O
but  O
surprisingly  O
it  O
matched  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O

The  O
Chicken  O

with  O

except  O
substituting  O
the  O

wrapped  O
in  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
as  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

I  O
shared  O
with  O
the  O
chef  O
that  O
the  O
Laksa  O
gravy  O
was  O
very  O
nice  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
distinct  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavours  O
.  O

In  O
simple  O
word  O
,  O
it  O
simply  O
taste  O
like  O
laksa  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
that  O
cheong  O
fan  O
felt  O
separated  O
as  O
it  O
didn'tabsorb  O
the  O
gravy  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
was  O
very  O
receptive  O
and  O
even  O
suggestedserving  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O
with  O
more  O
laksa  O
gravy  O
andtweaking  O
the  O
texture  O
by  O
having  O
the  O
cheong  O
fan  O
in  O
smaller  O
pieces  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
them  O
refining  O
the  O
dish.If  O
they  O
can  O
get  O
the  O
formulae  O
right  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
hit  O
with  O
the  O
local  O
.  O

Sar  O
Kok  O
Liew  O
(  O
Stuffed  O
Yambean  O
)  O
4.2/5  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
with  O
the  O
famous  O
Ipoh  O
Sar  O
Kok  O
Liew  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Stuffed  O
Yambean  O
(  O
$  O
0.50/pc  O
)  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
chef  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
very  O
labour  O
intensive  O
and  O
availability  O
is  O
subjected  O
to  O
his  O
mood  O
.  O

Many  O
layers  O
of  O
textures  O
await  O
you  O
as  O
you  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
crisp  O
from  O
the  O
outer  O
layer  O
,  O
the  O
chewy  O
texture  O
that  O
felt  O
like  O
eating  O
nian  O
gao  O
and  O
the  O
crunchy  O
juicy  O
chopped  O
bitesof  O
the  O
stuffed  O
yambean  O
was  O
something  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
that  O
one  O
is  O
never  O
enough  O
.  O

Organic  O

4.2/5  O

If  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
your  O
soya  O
bean  O
drink  O
too  O
sweet  O
,  O
then  O
I  O
think  O
the  O
Organic  O
Soya  O
Bean  O

The  O
drink  O
had  O
astronger  O
soya  O
bean  O
flavour  O
compared  O
to  O
most  O
which  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
and  O
preferred  O
.  O

In  O
my  O

,  O
it  O
tasted  O
more  O
natural  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
at  O
The  O

because  O
eating  O
salad  O
is  O
never  O
boring  O
again  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
have  O
my  O
choice  O
of  O

that  O
satisfied  O
the  O
carnivore  O
in  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O
serving  O
is  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
a  O
full  O
meal  O
that  O
guaranteed  O
to  O
leave  O
you  O

I  O

the  O

probably  O
it  O
was  O
tomato  O

Last  O
but  O
not  O
least  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
red  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
fresh  O

crunchy  O
prawns  O
which  O
were  O
not  O
over  O
cooked  O
and  O
had  O
a  O

,  O
the  O
Pot  O

I  O

I  O
was  O
so  O
bloated  O
after  O
that  O
.  O

It  O
comes  O
with  O
choice  O
of  O
2  O
grills  O

6  O

.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
new  O

and  O
ordered  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Salsa  O
Duck  O
and  O
Buttered  O
Seared  O
Pacific  O
Dory  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprised  O
how  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tender  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
won  O
me  O
over  O
.  O

The  O
buttered  O
seared  O
pacific  O
dory  O
was  O
as  O
good  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
buttery  O
flavour  O
over  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
fish  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
herby  O
parsley  O
flavour  O
was  O
simply  O
heavenly  O
.  O

Is  O
the  O
grill  O
and  O
salad  O
really  O
that  O
good  O
?  O

Well  O
,  O
it  O
definitely  O
has  O
a  O
place  O
in  O
my  O
heart  O
and  O
I  O
actually  O
went  O
back  O
for  O
the  O
third  O
time  O
within  O
a  O
month  O

a  O
bit  O
weird  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferredit  O
to  O
be  O
steamed  O
rather  O
than  O
deep  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
Hot  O
Plate  O
Sambal  O
Seabass  O
(  O
$  O
25  O
)  O
was  O
lovely  O
with  O
the  O
sambal  O
sauce  O
.  O

If  O
only  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
spicer  O
would  O
be  O
nice  O

generous  O
Oyster  O
Omelette  O
(  O

I  O
have  O
ever  O
eaten  O
.  O

The  O
oyster  O
was  O
big  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
it  O
came  O
with  O
sambal  O

which  O
married  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
omelette  O

made  O
by  O

The  O

with  O

the  O

Compared  O
to  O

,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Beancurd  O
(  O
$  O
6  O

was  O
firmer  O
and  O
less  O

as  O
the  O
beancurd  O
was  O
bought  O
from  O
the  O
market  O
and  O
not  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O

a  O

Flavour  O
(  O

was  O
rather  O
unique  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O

lifted  O
the  O
flavour  O
to  O
another  O
level  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
cereal  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
bitter  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
it  O
was  O
over  O
done  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
cereal  O
to  O
be  O
sweeter  O
with  O
a  O
buttery  O
taste  O

it  O

I  O
have  O
started  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
liking  O
for  O

this  O
the  O
modern  O
version  O
of  O

The  O
traditional  O

turns  O
out  O
to  O
be  O
way  O
too  O
sweet  O

the  O

Buah  O

While  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Buah  O
Belinjau  O
Chips  O
.  O

Belinjau  O
is  O
a  O
fruit  O
that  O
has  O
medical  O
value  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
read  O
on  O
the  O
web  O
,  O
it  O
helps  O
to  O
reduce  O
sugar  O
level  O
in  O
the  O
blood  O
and  O
helps  O
protect  O
the  O
kidney  O
.  O

Compare  O
to  O
other  O
chips  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
rather  O
healthy  O
snack  O
as  O
no  O
flour  O
,  O
preservatives  O
or  O
colouring  O
is  O
added  O
.  O

The  O
buah  O
belinjau  O

has  O
a  O
subtle  O

taste  O
which  O
surprisingly  O
was  O
very  O

For  O
me  O
,  O
the  O
highlight  O
was  O
the  O

The  O
potato  O
croquette  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O

it  O

to  O
be  O

the  O

one  O
that  O

The  O
chicken  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
the  O

should  O
be  O
that  O

I  O

at  O
the  O

The  O
place  O
has  O
limited  O
seating  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
rather  O
hot  O

This  O

For  O
the  O

ordering  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
confusing  O

The  O
couple  O
of  O

that  O
itis  O
rather  O

After  O
trying  O
out  O
a  O
few  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Doubled  O
Sided  O
Pan  O
recipes  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
challenge  O
myself  O
to  O
cook  O
something  O
more  O
sophisticated  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
make  O
home  O
made  O
Char  O
Siew  O
!  O

So  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
supermarket  O
and  O
bought  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
pork  O
loin  O
.  O

I  O
marinated  O
the  O
pork  O
loin  O
and  O
left  O
it  O
overnight  O
.  O

I  O
realized  O
my  O
char  O
siew  O
did  O
not  O
fully  O
absorb  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

After  O
checking  O
with  O
some  O
kitchen  O
experts  O
,  O
they  O
advised  O
me  O
to  O
poke  O
holes  O
in  O
the  O
meat  O
next  O
time  O
when  O
I  O
want  O
to  O
marinate  O
.  O

The  O
Char  O
Siew  O
was  O
also  O
lacking  O
in  O
sweetness  O
and  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
how  O
on  O
earth  O
I  O
have  O
left  O
out  O
the  O
honey  O
in  O
the  O
recipe  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
finally  O
product  O
of  O
my  O
grilled  O
Char  O
Siew  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
manage  O
to  O
control  O
the  O
fire  O
well  O
and  O
I  O
should  O
have  O
checked  O
the  O
meat  O
more  O
often  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
Char  O
Siew  O
was  O
still  O
very  O
beautiful  O
inside  O
.  O

Hopefully  O
I  O
can  O
perfect  O
it  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
attempt  O
.  O

Every  O
year  O
for  O
my  O
parents  O
birthday  O
,  O
our  O
family  O
will  O
brainstorm  O
for  O
a  O
restaurant  O
to  O
bring  O
the  O
old  O
folks  O
to  O
celebrate  O
their  O
birthday  O
.  O

My  O
mother  O
's  O
birthday  O
falls  O
in  O
May  O
this  O
monthand  O
my  O
youngest  O
sister  O
suggested  O
going  O
for  O
dim  O
sum  O
since  O
the  O
2  O
old  O
folks  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
one  O
.  O

Instantly  O
I  O
suggested  O
Royal  O
Chinaas  O
I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
after  O
reading  O
good  O
reviews  O
of  O
their  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Chicken  O
Claws  O
in  O
Spicy  O
Sauce  O
4/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Chicken  O
Claws  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
or  O
some  O
calledit  O
phoenix  O
claws  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
for  O
me  O
whenever  O
I  O
go  O
for  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

Some  O
people  O
are  O
disgust  O
with  O
the  O
sight  O
but  O
for  O
me  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
such  O
a  O
delicacy  O
.  O

The  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
gave  O
the  O
chicken  O
claws  O
another  O
lift  O
in  O
flavours  O
which  O
I  O
thought  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
and  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
4.8/5  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
BEST  O
Steamed  O
Prawn  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
or  O
Har  O
Gaos  O
,  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

The  O
freshness  O
and  O
crunchiness  O
of  O
the  O
prawn  O
just  O
simply  O
blown  O
me  O
away.I  O
felt  O
like  O
I  O
was  O
just  O
eating  O
the  O
prawn  O
itself  O
without  O
the  O
thin  O
translucent  O
skin  O
wrapped  O
around  O
it  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
see  O
how  O
thin  O
the  O
skin  O
was  O
,  O
it  O
looked  O
like  O
the  O
prawn  O
is  O
trying  O
to  O
break  O
free  O
from  O
it  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Wolfberry  O
4.8/5  O

I  O
have  O
known  O
of  O
friends  O
who  O
do  O
n't  O
eat  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
or  O
Steam  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
portion  O
of  O
minced  O
meat  O
in  O
it  O
and  O
that  O
porky  O
taste  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
the  O
siew  O
mai  O
was  O
constructed  O
with  O
minced  O
meat  O
sandwiched  O
in  O
between  O
2  O
fresh  O
prawns  O
.  O

The  O
minced  O
meat  O
portionwas  O
lesserand  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
their  O
version  O
as  O
it  O
has  O
more  O
flavours  O
andcontrasting  O
textures  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Congee  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
smooth  O
and  O
silky  O
Seafood  O
Congee  O
(  O
$  O
8.50  O
)  O
will  O
definitely  O
warm  O
your  O
stomach  O
for  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
delicious  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
think  O
that  O
Royal  O
China  O
is  O
very  O
generous  O
with  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
prawns  O
.  O

Look  O

huge  O
prawn  O

of  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Custard  O

(  O

was  O
like  O

a  O

is  O
a  O

and  O
seeing  O
the  O

I  O
personally  O
was  O
a  O

disappointed  O
with  O

as  O
it  O
lacked  O
the  O

taste  O

Chef  O
Qua  O
's  O
fruit  O
rojak  O
is  O
rather  O
unique  O

spicy  O

The  O

coated  O
with  O
the  O
spicy  O
special  O
sauce  O
from  O
Chef  O
Qua  O
's  O
recipe  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
a  O
thoughtful  O
dish  O
as  O
the  O
juiciness  O
of  O
the  O
fruits  O
can  O
help  O
to  O
smoothen  O
the  O
spiciness  O
on  O
the  O

Malay  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
BEST  O

Maybe  O
Malaysia  O

should  O
consider  O
labelling  O
it  O
as  O
one  O
of  O
their  O
uniquely  O
iconic  O
Malaysian  O

.  O

The  O

Fugu  O
Mirin  O
Boshi  O
4/5  O

When  O
I  O
knew  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
serve  O
me  O
Fugu  O
which  O
is  O
puffer  O
fish  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
anticipating  O
this  O
dish  O
with  O
anxiety  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
puffer  O
fish  O
and  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
deadly  O
if  O
not  O
being  O
prepared  O
properly  O
.  O

Actually  O
Fugu  O
Mirin  O
Boshi  O
(  O
$  O
12++  O
)  O
is  O
very  O
different  O
from  O
what  O
I  O
have  O
imagined  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
dried  O
puffer  O
fish  O
seasoned  O
with  O
sweet  O
sake.It  O
is  O
a  O
traditional  O
snack  O
eaten  O
while  O
drinking  O
sake  O
.  O

While  O
some  O
of  O
us  O
debated  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
Bak  O
Kwa  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
tasted  O
more  O
like  O
dried  O
Cuttlefish  O
.  O

Opening  O
the  O
lid  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Chawanmushi  O
(  O
$  O
7++  O
)  O
is  O
dark  O
in  O
colour  O
.  O

Upon  O
tasting  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
it  O
had  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
soy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Initiallythe  O
dishtasted  O
salty  O
but  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
eaten  O
with  O
the  O
right  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
smooth  O
egg  O
custard  O
,  O
the  O
taste  O
was  O
actually  O
quite  O
delectable  O
and  O
light  O
and  O
yet  O
refreshing  O
.  O

Gyu  O
Shioyaki  O
is  O
charcoal  O
grilled  O

pepper  O

.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
special  O
mayonnaise  O
mustard  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
heavenly  O
and  O
the  O
sauce  O
simply  O
give  O
it  O
a  O
new  O
level  O
of  O
enjoyment  O

I  O

We  O
were  O
also  O
given  O
complimentary  O
Quiche  O
which  O
is  O
bursting  O
with  O
flavours  O
.  O

It  O
got  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
excited  O
,  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
our  O
mains  O

7  O
Adam  O
Trio  O
4/5  O

The  O
7  O
Adam  O
Trio  O
(  O
$  O
27  O
)  O
Appetiser  O
consists  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
,  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
and  O
Fresh  O
slices  O
of  O
Tuna  O
Loins  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
of  O
the  O
three  O
is  O
the  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
.  O

Biting  O
into  O
the  O
crispy  O
crab  O
cake  O
,  O
a  O
rush  O
of  O
beautiful  O
flavours  O
hit  O
the  O
taste  O
buds  O
,  O
sending  O
them  O
dancing  O
in  O
delights  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
what  O
is  O
the  O
sauce  O
for  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
,  O
it  O
came  O
to  O
be  O
as  O
something  O
that  O
has  O
caramel  O
sweetness  O
.  O

I  O
found  O
the  O
texture  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
mushy  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
Tuna  O
Loins  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
a  O
shadow  O
to  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
and  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
.  O

I  O
guess  O
the  O
strong  O
flavours  O
from  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
and  O
Crab  O
Cake  O
could  O
have  O
overshadowed  O
it  O
.  O

Wagyu  O
Beef  O
Cheek  O
,  O
Mash  O
of  O
Yam  O
4/5  O

The  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
Cheek  O
(  O
$  O
37  O
)  O
looks  O
rather  O
ordinary  O
sitting  O
on  O
a  O
mash  O
of  O
Yam  O
and  O
Spinach  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
cheeknot  O
only  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
,  O
it  O
melted  O
my  O
heart  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
tender.For  O
the  O
Yam  O
mash  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
potato  O
mash  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
tell  O
the  O
different  O
.  O

Baba  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
4/5  O

The  O
Baba  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
(  O
$  O
37  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
sweet  O
caramelized  O
crisp  O
outer  O
layer  O
with  O
tender  O
meat  O
falling  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
.  O

The  O
ribs  O
were  O
well  O
executed  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
the  O
wow  O
factor  O
inwhat  O
the  O
chef  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
show  O
in  O
his  O
cooking  O
.  O

Cod  O
fish  O
Confit  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Cod  O
fish  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
consists  O
of  O
two  O
huge  O
fillets  O
of  O
pan  O
seared  O
cod  O
fish  O
sat  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
pilaf  O
rice  O
with  O
orange  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
cod  O
fish  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
saucing  O
was  O
rather  O
light  O
and  O
the  O
whole  O
dish  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
ordinary  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

Duck  O
Confit  O
2.5/5  O

The  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
with  O
Szechuan  O
pepper  O
salt  O
(  O
$  O
37  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
big  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
tough  O
and  O
chewy  O
.  O

We  O
werebasically  O
chewing  O
the  O
duck  O
confit  O
!  O

Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Tart  O
2.5/5  O

The  O
Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
looks  O
beautiful  O
but  O
again  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
ws  O
rather  O
simple  O
to  O
be  O
charging  O
$  O
15  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
joking  O
amount  O
ourselves  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
easily  O
put  O
the  O
dish  O
together  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
warn  O
that  O
the  O
tart  O
base  O
is  O
extremely  O
hard  O
and  O
difficult  O
dessert  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
like  O
trying  O
to  O
break  O
the  O
tart  O
.  O

Yes  O
!  O

breaking  O
the  O
tart  O
not  O
cutting  O
the  O
tart  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
pastry  O
has  O
an  O
interesting  O
sweet  O
flavour  O
which  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
thought  O
it  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
water  O
chestnut  O
pastry  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Fondant  O
4/5  O

The  O
Chocolate  O
Fondant  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
withcaramel  O
sauce  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
lovely  O
.  O

In  O
summary  O
formy  O
dinner  O
experience  O
at  O
7Adam  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
give  O
full  O
marks  O
for  O
its  O
ambience  O
.  O

Food  O
wise  O
I  O
did  O
have  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
deciding  O
my  O
main  O
as  O
the  O
menuhas  O
someinteresting  O
fusion  O
of  O
flavours  O
and  O
ingredients  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
dishes  O
turned  O
out  O
mediocre  O
and  O
it  O
did  O
n't  O
excite  O
me  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
price  O
tag  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
sure  O
I  O
can  O
find  O
better  O
food  O
elsewhere  O
unless  O
you  O
are  O
willing  O
to  O
pay  O
for  O
the  O
ambience  O

I  O
used  O
to  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
seventh  O
month  O
festive  O
at  O
my  O
neighbourhood  O
because  O
when  O
there  O
was  O
Chinese  O
Opera  O
or  O
Getai  O
performance  O
,  O
these  O
mobile  O
hawkers  O
will  O
appear  O
from  O
nowhere  O
to  O
sell  O
local  O
snacks  O
and  O
my  O
all  O
time  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
.  O

Except  O
for  O
the  O
famous  O

Muah  O
Chee  O
stall  O
that  O
has  O
moved  O
to  O
Blk  O

Bedok  O
South  O
,  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
remember  O
knowing  O
anywhere  O
selling  O
them  O
now  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
went  O
onto  O
theweb  O
and  O
found  O

not  O
the  O
dough  O
will  O
stick  O
to  O
the  O
plate/container  O
and  O
hard  O
to  O
remove  O
later  O
.  O

After  O
preparing  O
the  O
sesame  O
and  O
peanut  O
powder  O
,  O
I  O
transferred  O
the  O
dough  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
pan  O
to  O
mix  O
with  O
the  O
peanut  O
mixture  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
caster  O
sugar  O
so  O
I  O
used  O
normal  O
sugar  O
instead  O
.  O

The  O
normal  O
sugar  O
gave  O
the  O
Muah  O
Chee  O
a  O
rough  O
texture  O
.  O

My  O
advice  O
is  O
to  O
skip  O
the  O
sugar  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
have  O
caster  O
sugar  O
.  O

It  O
will  O
still  O
taste  O
as  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
last  O
step  O
is  O
to  O
cut  O
the  O
dough  O
into  O
small  O
pieces  O
,  O
mixed  O
them  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
peanut  O
mixture  O
and  O
you  O
are  O
ready  O
to  O
serve  O

I  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
restaurant  O
on  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
,  O
the  O
decor  O
and  O
ambient  O
instantly  O
made  O
me  O
felt  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
back  O
in  O
Korea  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
Korean  O
diners  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
seems  O
quite  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
Korean  O
community  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
buffet  O
spread  O
area  O
does  O
not  O
look  O
big  O
but  O
it  O
offers  O
a  O
good  O
variety  O
of  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
cuisines  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
a  O
cooked  O
food  O
section  O
that  O
offers  O
dishes  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
Rice  O
Cake  O
,  O
Korean  O
pancakes  O
and  O
etc  O
...  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
section  O
offering  O
different  O
Korean  O
sides  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
the  O
main  O
MEAT  O
section  O
!  O
!  O
!  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
different  O
types  O
of  O
Beef  O
,  O
Pork  O
,  O
Lamb  O
and  O
even  O
prawns  O
that  O
were  O
available  O
.  O

They  O
have  O
original  O
flavours  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
marinated  O
meats.A  O
staffis  O
stationed  O
at  O
the  O
meat  O
section  O
and  O
whenever  O
the  O
meat  O
is  O
running  O
low  O
,  O
he  O
will  O
quickly  O
topped  O
it  O
up  O
.  O

Many  O
buffet  O
restaurants  O
would  O
sliced  O
their  O
meat  O
into  O
thin  O
strips  O
to  O
cut  O
down  O
on  O
cost  O
but  O
look  O
at  O
those  O
pieces  O
of  O
meat  O
onthe  O
BBQ  O
grill  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
why  O
I  O
have  O
said  O
earlier  O
it  O
is  O
worth  O
paying  O
the  O
amount  O
as  O
the  O
restaurant  O
never  O
cut  O
back  O
on  O
quality  O

am  O

cooking  O
seem  O
so  O
easy  O
overnight  O

I  O
decide  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
all  O
the  O
necessary  O
ingredients  O
as  O
in  O
Cuisine  O
Paradise  O

hence  O
I  O
make  O
do  O
with  O
what  O
I  O
could  O
find  O
in  O
the  O

.  O

Instead  O
of  O
chicken  O
,  O
I  O
used  O
pork  O

For  O
vegetables  O
,  O
I  O
used  O
snow  O
peas  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
madeseveral  O
mistakes  O
in  O
the  O

such  O
as  O
putting  O

too  O

,  O
the  O
snow  O
peas  O
have  O
been  O
cooked  O
too  O
long  O
and  O
turned  O
yellow  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
rice  O
turned  O
out  O
quite  O
nice  O
and  O
has  O
similar  O

as  O

The  O

(  O

indeed  O
was  O
very  O
authentic  O

.  O

It  O
definitely  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
had  O
outside  O

.  O

Quantity  O
was  O
also  O
not  O

The  O
thick  O

gravy  O
also  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O

of  O

The  O
Olive  O
Rice  O
(  O

was  O
fluffy  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O

the  O

was  O
served  O
with  O
walnuts  O
,  O
shredded  O
carrot  O
and  O
shredded  O
mango  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
gave  O
the  O
dish  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
dimension  O
in  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O
.  O

By  O
the  O
way  O
,  O
I  O
forgot  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
photo  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

This  O
was  O

!  O

I  O
have  O
bought  O
my  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Double  O
Sided  O
Pan  O
from  O
G  O
market  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
and  O
has  O
been  O
looking  O
for  O
a  O
simple  O
recipe  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
cook  O
so  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
challenging  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
try  O
any  O
recipe  O
that  O
involes  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
processes  O
or  O
cutting  O
.  O

I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
Noob  O
Cook  O
Coca  O
Cola  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
recipeand  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
simple  O
andeasy.So  O
over  O
the  O
weekend  O
,  O
the  O
Happy  O
Call  O
Double  O
Sided  O
Pan  O
lost  O
its  O
virginity  O
to  O
a  O
novice  O
cook  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
12  O
mid  O
joint  O
chicken  O
wings  O
marinaded  O
for  O
30  O
minutesin  O
light  O
soy  O
sauce  O
,  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
sesame  O
oil  O
.  O

Noob  O
Cook  O
recipe  O
mentioned  O
to  O
marinade  O
for  O
15  O
minutes  O
but  O
I  O
double  O
it  O
hoping  O
that  O
the  O
meat  O
will  O
be  O
more  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Next  O
I  O
brown  O
the  O
chicken  O
wings  O
on  O
both  O
sides  O
beside  O
pouring  O
the  O
coca  O
cola  O
,  O
water  O
and  O
left  O
over  O
marinade  O
sauce  O
into  O
the  O
pan  O
and  O
let  O
it  O
simmer  O
until  O
it  O
is  O
reduced  O
to  O
a  O
dark  O
sticky  O
syrup  O
.  O

I  O
suspect  O
I  O
used  O
too  O
much  O
of  O
the  O
liquid  O
mixture  O
and  O
it  O
told  O
more  O
than  O
15-20  O
minutes  O
(  O
mentioned  O
in  O
Noob  O
Cook  O
recipe  O
)  O
for  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
reduced  O

After  O
about  O
30  O
minutes  O

is  O
my  O

Parade  O
Laksa  O
,  O

Katong  O
Laksa  O
and  O
328  O
Katong  O
Laksa  O
.  O

At  O
Holland  O
Village  O
there  O
is  O
an  O
eatery  O
along  O
Lorong  O
Liput  O
that  O
sells  O
363  O
Katong  O
Laksa  O
.  O

I  O
tried  O
to  O
look  O
up  O
its  O
history  O
but  O
could  O
not  O
find  O
anything  O
to  O
give  O
me  O
more  O
insight  O
of  O
this  O
eatery  O
.  O

Share  O
with  O
me  O
if  O
you  O
know  O
,  O
thank  O
you  O
in  O
advance  O
.  O

Besides  O
selling  O
Laksa  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
also  O
sells  O
otak  O
.  O

They  O
even  O
have  O
a  O
combo  O
meal  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
,  O
a  O
can  O
drink  O
and  O
a  O
piece  O
of  O
otak  O

you  O
are  O
not  O

Crumpler  O
Karachi  O
Outpost  O
(  O
S  O
)  O

I  O
use  O
a  O
Crumpler  O
Karachi  O
Outpost  O
backpack  O
to  O
carry  O
my  O
camera  O
and  O
other  O
stuffs  O
.  O

The  O
Crumpler  O
Karachi  O
Outpost  O
comes  O
in  O
3  O
sizes  O
and  O
I  O
bought  O
the  O
smallest  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
camera  O
and  O
laptop  O
bag  O
.  O

It  O
can  O
hold  O
a  O
13  O
''  O
laptop  O
with  O
fully  O
configurable  O
and  O
removeable  O
padded  O
laptop  O
and  O
main  O
compartments  O
.  O

The  O
bag  O
was  O
quite  O
an  O
expensive  O
investment  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
I  O
spent  O
$  O
215  O
on  O
it  O
after  O
10  O
%  O
credit  O
card  O
discount  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
love  O
at  O
first  O
sight  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
buy  O
it  O
immediately  O
.  O

I  O
gave  O
myself  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
to  O
look  O
for  O
other  O
cheaper  O
alternatives  O
before  O
going  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
shop  O
toget  O

)  O

When  O
I  O
started  O
my  O
blog  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
using  O
my  O
Iphone  O
3GS  O
and  O
compact  O
Canon  O
IXUS  O
120IS  O
digital  O
camera  O
to  O
shoot  O
my  O
photos  O
.  O

It  O
was4  O
monthsago  O
that  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
``  O
go  O
to  O
the  O
dark  O
side  O
''  O
and  O
invested  O
in  O
a  O
DSLR  O
camera  O
.  O

I  O
got  O
myself  O
a  O
basic  O
DSLR  O
camera  O
,  O
the  O
Canon  O
600D  O
with  O
Kit  O
II  O
(  O
EF  O
S18-135IS  O
)  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
afraid  O
to  O
handle  O
the  O
complicated  O
equipment  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
clueless  O
what  O
to  O
do  O
with  O
it  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
guidance  O
and  O
help  O
from  O
fellow  O
foodies  O
especially  O
Maureen  O
from  O
MissTamChiak  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
more  O
comfortable  O
in  O
handling  O
the  O
equipment  O
.  O

Lately  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
thinking  O
of  O
getting  O
a  O
flash  O
and  O
a  O
macro  O
lens  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
these  O
do  O
not  O
come  O
cheap  O
.  O

I  O
wonder  O
if  O
any  O
Santa  O
Claus  O
out  O
there  O
is  O
reading  O
this  O
blog  O

The  O
Iphone  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
greatest  O
inventions  O
of  O
all  O
the  O
time  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
a  O
compact  O
mobile  O
computer  O
that  O
keeps  O
me  O
connected  O
at  O
all  O
times  O
beside  O
the  O
normal  O
call  O
function  O
.  O

My  O
Iphone  O
3GS  O
keeps  O
me  O
connected  O
on  O
social  O
media  O
and  O
I  O
am  O
frequently  O
on  O
Twitter  O
,  O
Path  O
,  O
Instagram  O
andFoursquare  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
my  O
navigator  O
,  O
helping  O
me  O
to  O
get  O
from  O
one  O
place  O
to  O
another  O
.  O

It  O
doubles  O
up  O
as  O
my  O
notepad  O
too  O
.  O

I  O
used  O
it  O
tonote  O
down  O
my  O
food  O
experience  O
when  O
I  O
visit  O
a  O
restaurant/cafe/stall  O
.  O

Everyone  O
who  O
owns  O
an  O
Iphone  O
will  O
know  O
the  O
Iphone  O
battery  O
would  O
notlast  O
you  O
for  O

Whenever  O
I  O
know  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
out  O
for  O
the  O
whole  O
day  O
,  O
I  O
will  O
bring  O
the  O
Iphone  O

along  O
.  O

Who  O
says  O
man  O
does  O
not  O
carry  O

?  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
in  O
my  O

.  O

After  O
all  O
,  O
a  O
few  O
thousand  O
dollars  O

do  O
n't  O

the  O
unpredictable  O
Singapore  O
weather  O

Crumpler  O

Singapore  O
weather  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
extreme  O
and  O
it  O
can  O
get  O
pretty  O
hot  O
and  O
humid  O
too  O
.  O

I  O
do  O
perspire  O
quite  O
easily  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
nice  O
to  O
attend  O
a  O
food  O
tasting  O
invite  O
when  O
I  O
am  O
soaked  O
in  O
perspiration  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
usually  O
carry  O
a  O
towel  O
to  O
clean  O
myself  O
up  O
and  O
a  O
Threadless  O
T-shirt  O
to  O
change  O
into  O
.  O

Threadless  O
is  O
an  O
online  O
T-shirt  O
shop  O
that  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
last  O
year  O
.  O

Since  O
then  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
buying  O
my  O
tees  O
from  O
the  O
online  O
shop  O
.  O

I  O
hope  O
you  O

That  O
is  O
what  O
I  O
usually  O
have  O
in  O
my  O

when  O
I  O
go  O
to  O
check  O
out  O

not  O

of  O
Chicken  O
Chasyu  O
instead  O
of  O
Pork  O
Chasyu  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
meat  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
tender  O
and  O

.  O

It  O
was  O

The  O
CT  O

Beef  O
Burger  O
(  O

was  O
a  O
tad  O
dry  O
although  O
the  O
patty  O
was  O
meaty  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

Maybe  O
it  O
was  O
because  O
it  O
was  O
left  O
sitting  O
there  O
for  O

long  O
with  O
all  O

I  O
wish  O
it  O
could  O
be  O
more  O
messy  O
for  O
some  O
juiciness  O
to  O
it  O
such  O
as  O

still  O
remember  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
with  O
Spice  O
Sutra  O
a  O
few  O
years  O
back  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
good  O
reviews  O
about  O
the  O

on  O
Hungrygowhere.com  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
and  O
I  O
decide  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O

However  O
we  O
made  O
a  O
last  O
minute  O
U-turn  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
's  O
doorstep  O
as  O
there  O
were  O
hardly  O
any  O

.  O

Thanks  O

myself  O
whether  O

so  O
that  O
we  O
can  O

The  O

was  O
the  O
surprise  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
Basmati  O
rice  O
absorbed  O
the  O
aromatic  O
flavours  O
from  O
the  O
spices  O
and  O
retained  O
themoisture  O
making  O
the  O
rice  O
very  O
fragrant  O
.  O

is  O
a  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
warm  O

rather  O
unique  O
to  O
me  O
,  O
kind  O
of  O
like  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
melted  O
cheese  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
light  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
cheesy  O
.  O

Buffalo  O
Wings  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
thought  O
Buffalo  O
Wings  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
hot  O
and  O
spicy  O
but  O
the  O
mid  O
joint  O
wings  O
were  O
on  O
the  O
sweet  O
side  O
,  O
deep  O
fried  O
and  O
glazed  O
with  O
BBQ  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
buffalo  O
wings  O
came  O
with  O
celery  O
and  O
blue  O
cheese  O
dressing  O
just  O
like  O
how  O
it  O
was  O
traditionally  O
served  O
.  O

Black  O
Pepper  O
Crab  O
4/5  O

When  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Crab  O
Pizza  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
will  O
come  O
out  O
something  O
on  O
the  O
black  O
colored  O
side  O
but  O
I  O
was  O
wrong  O
as  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photo  O
.  O

The  O
pizza  O
has  O
crab  O
claw  O
meats  O
,  O
shredded  O
crab  O
sticks  O
,  O
sliced  O
onions  O
in  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
cheese  O
spread  O
on  O
a  O
thin  O
crust  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
diced  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
chopped  O
cilantro  O
.  O

Interesting  O
concept  O
but  O
it  O
lacks  O
the  O
distinct  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
black  O
pepper  O
.  O

Roasted  O
Duck  O
with  O
Hoisin  O
sauce  O
4/5  O

Another  O
interesting  O
pizza  O
we  O
had  O
was  O
the  O
Roasted  O
Duck  O
with  O
Hoisin  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
pizza  O
has  O
sliced  O
roasted  O
duck  O
,  O
hoisin  O
sauce  O
,  O
shiitake  O
mushroom  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
cheese  O
on  O
a  O
thin  O
crust  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
crispy  O
popiah  O
skin  O
and  O
drizzles  O
of  O
hoisin  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
say  O
it  O
is  O
kind  O
of  O
an  O
acquired  O
taste  O
if  O
you  O
prefer  O
the  O
traditional  O
pizza  O
.  O

The  O
crispy  O
popiah  O
skin  O
and  O
hoisin  O
sauce  O
were  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
pizza  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
appreciate  O
if  O
there  O
were  O
more  O
duck  O
meats  O
though  O
.  O

offers  O
a  O
huge  O
varieties  O
of  O
Prata  O
.  O

Actually  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
something  O
new  O
or  O
unique  O
.  O

Many  O

,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O

Mushroom  O
Prata  O
.  O

ThePrata  O

fluffy  O

for  O
the  O

The  O

was  O

Myfamilywent  O
to  O
Cafe  O
Mosaic  O
atCarltonHotelto  O
celebrate  O
my  O
dad  O
's  O
birthday  O
.  O

Usually  O
we  O
celebrate  O
his  O
birthday  O
at  O
some  O
Chinese  O
restaurants  O
but  O
I  O
suggest  O
a  O
change  O
sincemy  O
parenthas  O
nevergone  O
for  O
International  O
Buffet  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
seventh  O
dayof  O
the  O
Lunar  O
New  O
Year  O
which  O
means  O
Renri  O
(  O
)  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
Chinese  O
customs  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
day  O
human  O
beings  O
were  O
created  O
.  O

Celebrating  O
the  O
day  O
vary  O
from  O
place  O
to  O
place  O
.  O

In  O
Singapore  O
,  O
we  O
will  O
have  O
Yusheng  O
(  O
)  O
or  O
Prosperity  O
Toss  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
Lo  O
Hei  O
(  O
)  O
in  O
Cantonese  O
.  O

Yusheng  O
is  O
considered  O
a  O
symbol  O
of  O
abundance  O
,  O
prosperity  O
and  O
vigor  O
as  O
it  O
sounds  O
like  O
(  O
)  O
meaning  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
abundance  O
.  O

The  O
comtemporary  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Yusheng  O
(  O
)  O
is  O
said  O
to  O
be  O
created  O
and  O
popularised  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
usually  O
consists  O
of  O
strips  O
of  O
raw  O
fish  O
,  O
mixed  O
with  O
shredded  O
vegetables  O
and  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
sauces  O
and  O
condiments  O
.  O

Cafe  O
Mosaic  O
exudes  O
a  O
sense  O
of  O
warmth  O
and  O
comfort.The  O
contemporary  O
cafe  O
brought  O
together  O
Asian  O
and  O
Western  O
culinary  O
favourites  O
,  O
giving  O
one  O
a  O
taste  O
of  O
what  O
the  O
best  O
of  O
Singapore  O
has  O
to  O
offer  O
.  O

Be  O
spoilt  O
with  O
a  O
kaleidoscope  O
of  O
culinary  O
choices  O
in  O
their  O
buffet  O
spread  O
.  O

The  O
cold  O
section  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
varieties  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
very  O
fresh  O
and  O
promptly  O
replenished  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
also  O
a  O
salad  O
section  O
with  O
a  O
good  O
selection  O
of  O
variety  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
jellyfish  O
and  O
cold  O
tofu  O
.  O

International  O
Buffet  O
nowaday  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
sushi  O
.  O

I  O
usually  O
skip  O
the  O
sushi  O
because  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
very  O
filling  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
tried  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
cooked  O
food  O
section  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Scallop  O
,  O
Asparagus  O
with  O
XO  O
sauce  O
and  O
Braised  O
Pig  O
Trotters  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
pretty  O
good  O
and  O
worth  O
trying  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
resisttrying  O
the  O
beautiful  O
slab  O
of  O
Roast  O
Pork  O
calling  O
out  O
for  O
me  O

a  O
way  O
helps  O
toclear  O
all  O
the  O
oiliness  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
peppery  O
but  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
mind  O
.  O

Ienjoy  O
the  O
peppery  O
kick  O
from  O
